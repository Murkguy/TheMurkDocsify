# The World of The Murk

## Why Include Setting in an SRD?

The Murk's setting is just as important as the rules it plays by. The Gods, history, and the reasons magic work in the ways it does is tied inexorably to the world it exists in. As such, The Murk is not setting agnostic and in an effort to make sure _everyone_ is able to pick up and play, the introductory information is presented here.

## Introduction

The world, once vibrant and full of promise, now stands on the precipice of failure and decay. It is a gradual decline that may span centuries, but the eventual outcome seems inevitable: humanity, without some extraordinary salvation, will wither away, fading into oblivion, leaving behind nothing but a distant memory.

Amidst this impending catastrophe, the Princes and their Councils are not oblivious to the looming doom. Some among them tirelessly dedicate their efforts towards salvaging whatever remnants of hope and prosperity they can for their people. These noble souls toil day and night, driven by a desperate desire to stave off the encroaching darkness. However, not all are burdened by such noble intentions; there are those who indulge in reckless hedonism, engaging in lavish feasts and orgies, seeking fleeting pleasures as a means to distract themselves from the grim reality that surrounds them.

In the face of uncertainty and despair, the once-grand Cathedrals have become sanctuaries overflowing with desperate parishioners. Their anguished voices rise in fervent supplication, beseeching their deities for deliverance from the impending doom. Some gods answer their pleas, offering solace and guidance in these trying times, while others remain ominously silent, their intentions and existence questioned by the disillusioned masses. The distinction between divine intervention and divine indifference has blurred, leaving the faithful in a state of confusion and doubt.

Meanwhile, the towering Spires of the High Magisters buzz with ceaseless activity. These learned scholars and wielders of great magical power devote themselves tirelessly to preserve what shreds of humanity's legacy remain. Consumed by guilt for their perceived role in bringing about this calamitous state of affairs, they bear the weight of their hubris as the ultimate sin of mankind. Their tireless efforts serve as a testament to the depths of their remorse and the earnest desire to rectify the grave mistakes that have led to this precipice of destruction.

However, amidst the struggles of the ruling elite, the common folk find themselves caught in a downward spiral of worsening circumstances. The ravages of war have left scars that are not easily healed, as their sons and daughters were sent off to battle, compelled by duty and loyalty to defend their homeland. These brave souls returned forever changed, their spirits weighed down by the atrocities they witnessed and the deeds they were forced to commit. Gazing upon their own children, born into a world defined by chaos and suffering, they lament the loss of innocence and wonder what might have been in a world untouched by the horrors they have endured.

Such is the backdrop against which the tale of The Murk unfolds—a haunting narrative that chronicles the fate of those who have survived a world that has been reduced to ruins. It is a world that has witnessed the pinnacle of human achievement, only to descend into the abyss of despair and desolation.

---

The promise of a brave new world, envisioned by those who dedicated centuries of arduous work, relentless study, ceaseless effort, and unyielding progress, now seems like a cruel mockery of their endeavors. A priest of Le Vides, speaking in the year 5 After The Black Day, encapsulates the collective disillusionment: "How can this ruin be the reward for such pursuit?" The Vardan Empire, once a formidable bastion of power and unity, now stands fractured and fragmented. The central authority of the emperor, the might of his legions, and the sanctity of his laws have all faded into the annals of memory, mere vestiges of a bygone era.

In the wake of the empire's disintegration, the various principalities vie for supremacy, engaging in bitter power struggles among themselves, yet momentarily uniting only in the face of existential threats that threaten their very existence.

Amidst this desolation, a glimmer of hope once shone through the industrialization of magic—an innovation that brought a flicker of light to the beleaguered Empire. The fusion of Esoteria, the mystical arts, with assembly techniques created a revolutionary capacity to sustain, shelter, and arm a large population within the confines of relatively small territories. This newfound growth in production served as a boon for over a century, rekindling a sense of optimism and rejuvenation within the old Empire. Many anticipated that this resurgence would pave the way for a grand unification, a harmonious gathering of all former subjects under a banner of collective prosperity.

However, instead of achieving the long-awaited unity, this industrialized magic inadvertently became a bane, a catalyst that crippled the region. The Great War erupted, waged relentlessly between the bickering principalities and the encroaching Far Lands, their alliances in a constant state of flux. The heartland of the Vardan lands became the epicenter of this devastating conflict. Then, in an event shrouded in mystery, known simply as "The The Black Day," the Vardan homeland succumbed to an unimaginable magical catastrophe of cataclysmic proportions.

---

The details of the event remain cloaked in uncertainty, the truth obscured by the swirling fog of history. No one can definitively say what transpired or who was responsible for the The Black Day that befell the battle-scarred land. However, the Battle of Doria, a pivotal moment in the war, ended in eerie silence, followed by a cataclysmic explosion. From the aftermath of this detonation emerged a sinister sea of black fog, stretching for miles into the sky, mercilessly swallowing all life within its malevolent embrace. Thus, "The Murk" was born, an ominous testament to the irreversible destruction that had befallen the Vardan homeland.

Today, the Murk stands as a hauntingly silent gateway into the heart of the old Empire—a chilling reminder of the tragedies that have unfolded. While the principalities slowly begin to recover from the devastation, the deep-seated grudges and animosities of the past three decades have not been extinguished; they merely lie dormant, waiting for the opportune moment to resurface and ignite once again.

In the face of impending doom and the shattered remnants of a once-great civilization, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Will humanity find the strength and resilience to rise above the ashes and forge a new future, or will they succumb to the inexorable forces of decay and be consigned to the annals of forgotten history? Only time will tell as the tale of The Murk continues to unfold, chronicling the journey of those who dare to navigate the treacherous path that lies ahead.

# Lands of Tellus

While Tellus's wonders span far and wide, this supplement zeroes in on the heart of the central continent, particularly within the former territories of the illustrious Vardan Empire and the surrounding nations. While our focus is primarily on the former Empire’s peoples and their lands, it is crucial to note that this supplement does not claim to be an exhaustive compendium of all the peoples and territories that exist within the vast reaches of Tellus.

## Doria: The Legacy of Varranthal

![The Remnants of Doria](https://gyazo.com/ba68b0b6ad582ebb51c99795ac344d22)

Set deep within the heart of the old Vardan Empire, the lands that would later become the country of Doria hold an illustrious history. This region served as the birthplace of the original sixteen emperors, a testament to its significance as the pinnacle of power on all of Tellus. Indeed, the entirety of Doria was intricately intertwined with the legacy of the Vardan Empire, sharing not only its territories but also a capital city that remained unchanged—Varranthal.

The zenith of Doria's influence and supremacy began to wane following the ascension of Emperor Regieran to the realm beyond in 1331 BBD. In the wake of his departure, the empire descended into a tumultuous era of internal strife, characterized by intense power struggles and a revolving door of rulers.

Yet, amid the political turmoil, Doria experienced a resurgence under the reign of King Arminus Magnus, who ascended the throne in 745 BBD. With remarkable acumen, Arminus Magnus consolidated the fragmented political and military landscape, ushering in a new golden era for Doria. During this transformative period, the nation reclaimed much of its former homeland, reestablishing control over conquered territories and asserting dominance over neighboring regions. The conquest even extended southward, as Doria ventured into Kemet, subjugating the land while maintaining a puppet ruler in place. Although the empire did not retain the cohesion of its earlier days, Doria's influence reigned supreme for nearly 1600 years.

However, the tides of fate took an irreversible turn with the advent of The Black Day in 0 AC. As the catastrophic event unfolded, Doria found itself at the epicenter, its lands consumed by the insidious Murk—a rolling sea of malevolent black fog that devoured all in its path. The once-thriving nation became a desolate wasteland, with its people either perishing instantaneously or vanishing without a trace beneath the suffocating veil of the Murk. Only the expatriate Dorians managed to escape the grim fate, seeking refuge in the other nearby lands. Among these lands, Kemmet became the destination for the largest contingent of exiled Dorians, resulting in a complex social dynamic—a fragile caste system that grapples with the integration of Dorians and the indigenous population.

Today, the remnants of Doria stand as a haunting testament to the ravages of The Black Day and the enduring impact of the Murk. Varranthal, the capital city that once symbolized the might of the Vardan Empire, now lies silent and lifeless—a ghostly reminder of the nation's former grandeur. The scattered survivors of Doria's fall carry with them the weight of a shattered legacy and the indomitable spirit to rebuild amidst the shadows.

### Dorians at a Glance

![A Dorian Family in Exile](https://gyazo.com/48f1b2166d01eb172d28a9b7aea032fd)

**Noble Houses and Ancestral Lineage:**

Within the remnants of the Vardan Empire, the noble houses hold a prominent position in society, serving as the bedrock of political influence and social standing. Many individuals in the Near Lands take great pride in tracing their ancestry back to the Vardan Empire, as it signifies a connection to a glorious past and the fabled bloodlines of the imperial rulers.

The noble houses, often referred to as the "Houses of Legacy," are custodians of traditions, heritage, and the remnants of Vardan culture. They meticulously maintain extensive genealogical records, carefully documenting the lineage of their families, and proudly displaying their prestigious heritage. These ancestral connections are seen as a source of honor and legitimacy, granting the nobility a sense of entitlement and authority.

**Extensive Guild Systems:**

In the fabric of Doria's society, an intricate and elaborate guild system thrives, woven into the very essence of everyday life. These guilds are associations of skilled artisans, merchants, and professionals who come together to protect their trade secrets, uphold quality standards, and secure economic prosperity. Each guild operates as a self-governing body, setting its own regulations and hierarchies.

The guilds of Doria represent a diverse range of crafts and vocations, including the esteemed Guild of Arcanists, Guild of Blacksmiths, Guild of Traders, Guild of Scribes, and many others. Membership in these guilds is highly esteemed, offering individuals not only the opportunity for professional growth but also social recognition and access to exclusive networks.

**Honorable Duels and Matriarchal Families:**

Deeply ingrained in the cultural norms of Doria is the practice of honorable dueling. The concept of personal honor is paramount in this society, and conflicts or disputes between individuals are often resolved through ritualistic combat. These duels serve as a means to settle grievances, restore honor, and determine the rightful victor.

Another distinctive aspect of Dorian culture is the prevalence of matriarchal families. Women hold significant influence within these families, assuming the role of decision-makers and arrangers of marriages. Matrons, known as "Matriarchs," play a central role in selecting suitable matches for their children, considering factors such as social standing, compatibility, and strategic alliances. This matriarchal system reflects a balance of power and authority between genders and fosters a strong sense of familial unity and lineage preservation.

**Retaining Cultural Identity as a Nation in Refuge:**

The expatriate population of Dorians, forced to leave their homeland in the wake of The Black Day, has been resolute in preserving their cultural identity as a nation in refuge. Despite their scattered settlements and integration into foreign lands, they steadfastly cling to their customs, traditions, and language, carrying the flame of Dorian heritage wherever they go.

Dorian expatriates form tight-knit communities, creating social enclaves that serve as bastions of their cultural identity. These communities strive to maintain distinct customs, celebrate traditional festivals, and uphold the teachings of their ancestors. Language schools, cultural centers, and communal gatherings become focal points for preserving the Dorian way of life, ensuring that future generations remain connected to their roots.

This tenacious focus on cultural identity is not only a means of preserving the past but also a testament to the unyielding spirit of the Dorians. It serves as a reminder that, despite the shattered remnants of their once-mighty empire, the essence of Doria endures in the hearts and minds of its people, forging an unbreakable bond that transcends time and adversity.

## Caranth: The Chaos of Freedom

![The Caranthian Cityscape](https://gyazo.com/c1c4ffbb87d8ac6a5dc425062c0e0f46)

The land of Carantia, situated at the farthest reaches of the Vardan Empire, has always maintained its distinct culture and unwavering commitment to martial traditions. Its people, known for their warlike nature, hold military prowess and disciplined organization in high regard, prioritizing them above civil liberties. Even their artistic expressions bear the mark of their militant spirit, with towering spires adorned with vivid depictions of drills and triumphant victories.

Following the collapse of the empire, Carantia emerged as a formidable rival to Doria, sparking centuries of intense competition and warfare between the two powers. Their primary battleground became the Dorian vassal of Ruthenia, where their shared border became a constant backdrop of conflict, stained with bloodshed and the clash of steel.

Had it not been for The Black Day, Carantia may have achieved its ambition of conquering Doria and resurrecting the Imperium. However, the fateful battle of Doria witnessed the demise of the entire royal house of Carantia, with the exception of one sole survivor—Rorn, a distant nephew who inherited the weight of the fallen dynasty. Tragically, even his life was abruptly cut short by an assassin's hand, abruptly ending the VarZolen line.

Seizing the opportunity presented by this upheaval, activists and visionaries within Carantia drove the former kingdom toward a new era as a democracy. Over the past three decades, their efforts have borne fruit, resulting in the establishment of a democratic system. However, the transition has not been without challenges. Political factions now vie for influence and power, while the loss of their expert military force has left Carantia in a precarious and vulnerable position, susceptible to external threats.

### Caranthians at a Glance

![Caranthian Workshop with Apprentices](https://gyazo.com/6db873b132ee7721773013f0752bda70)

Carantia, situated on a rugged archipelago with towering mountains and breathtaking vistas, boasts a geography as diverse as its cultural heritage. Surrounded by vast seas, the Carantians have long been skilled navigators, mastering both conventional sea vessels and majestic airships that soar through the skies. Their maritime traditions are deeply ingrained in their way of life, and the sight of their ships dotting the horizon is a testament to their prowess.

**A Land of Lands:**

In the wake of the empire's collapse, Carantia experienced a significant transformation, evolving into a confederation of democratic city-states. Each city-state operates autonomously, with its own government, laws, and distinct character. While this confederation system ensures local autonomy, it also fosters a spirit of competition and occasional rivalry between the city-states. Yet, when faced with external threats or challenges, the Carantians have historically shown a remarkable ability to unite and defend their collective interests.

**Legendary Hosts:**

One of the hallmarks of Carantian culture is their legendary hospitality. The Carantians are renowned for their graciousness and warm welcome extended to visitors and guests. It is said that no one leaves Carantia without experiencing their generosity, feasting on sumptuous meals, and enjoying the finest entertainment. This tradition of hospitality is deeply rooted in their society and reflects their values of communal harmony and mutual respect.

Nestled at the base of a dormant volcano, Carantia is home to magnificent forgeworks that have been honed to perfection over generations. The intense heat and abundant mineral resources provided by the volcanic region have allowed the Carantians to excel in the art of metallurgy and craftsmanship. Skilled blacksmiths and artisans create exquisite weapons, armor, and ornamental pieces that are highly sought after throughout the continent. The glowing furnaces and rhythmic hammering of the forgeworks serve as a testament to Carantia's dedication to the mastery of their craft.
In the face of shifting fortunes and changing political landscapes, Carantia stands as a resilient land, holding onto its militant traditions, maritime legacy, democratic city-states, legendary hospitality, and the resounding clang of hammers shaping metal at the foot of a majestic volcano.

## Ruthenia: The Edge of Oblivion

![Novemgrod, the City of Mist](https://gyazo.com/f144e6d3442d94923fdb2d92452855fb)

Ruthenia was the second land to succumb to Varden's might and an initial partner in the formation of the Empire, boasts a multitude of vibrant and cosmopolitan cities among the Near Lands. Situated between the eastern reaches of Doria and the western expanse of Carantia, Ruthenia has long been a hotly contested region, witnessing centuries of conflict and ever-changing loyalties.

During the War, Ruthenia adeptly played both sides, skillfully maneuvering for increased power and influence. The collective cities of Ruthenia, recognizing their strategic value, sold their mercenary forces to the highest bidder, ensuring that their ancient conquerors remained weakened and incapable of launching successful campaigns against them.

However, the devastating The Black Day and the encroaching Murk took a severe toll on the eastern third of Ruthenia. The region was left in ruins, and many of the once-mighty political dynasties crumbled within a mere five years. Those who survived were thrust into a desperate struggle for stability, as they grappled with the aftermath of the catastrophe. The resilient and fiercely individualistic Ruthen people, known for their resourcefulness, brace themselves for a new era, ever watchful of the potential resurgence of their rival, Carantania.

In the midst of this tumultuous landscape, the metropolitan cities of Ruthenia continue to shine as beacons of culture and progress, their streets teeming with diversity and intellectual pursuits. Amidst the echoes of past battles and the looming threat of a resurgent Carantania, Ruthenia stands as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of its people.

### Ruthenians at a Glance

![Ruthenian soldiers waiting at the train station](https://gyazo.com/2a737948bffd95d3d69c967010eb4535)

**The Ancient and the New:**

Within the borders of Ruthenia, a land steeped in history and diverse influences, one finds a mesmerizing sight: the striking spired architecture that adorns its cities. Many of these architectural marvels pay homage to the original designs of the Vardan Empire, serving as a reminder of the region's glorious past. These towering structures stand as testaments to the architectural prowess and artistic ingenuity of the Ruthen people.

However, despite the grandeur of their cities, Ruthenia is not without its cultural divisions. A distinct gap exists between the rural peasantry, who toil under the vast expanse of the countryside, and the bustling industrial centers that dominate the urban landscapes. The cities are filled with factories, where the noise of machinery reverberates through the streets, creating a stark contrast to the serenity of the rural fields. This divide in lifestyles and aspirations often fuels tensions and a sense of disconnect between the two worlds.

**Serfs and Kings:**

Ruthenia's political structure is characterized by a system where the nobles, known as Korovladi, hold direct ownership of their lands under the rule of the Korvus - King. This hierarchical arrangement shapes the power dynamics within the realm, with the nobles exerting influence and control over their respective territories. The Korvus acts as the central authority, responsible for maintaining order and overseeing the affairs of the kingdom. This delicate balance of power between the monarchy and the noble class often plays a pivotal role in shaping the course of Ruthenia's history.

**The Grey Muses:**

At the heart of Ruthen culture lies the spirit of resilience and endurance. The people are stern and resolute, weathering the trials and tribulations that life throws their way. It is through this perseverance that the Ruthen people produce great works of writing, capturing the essence of their experiences and the soul of their nation. Some notable authors within the Ruthen literary tradition include:

-Ruvana Morozova - Renowned for her introspective and evocative poetry collection, "Whispers of the Frozen Land."
-Aleksander Petrovich - A master of historical fiction, his epic novel "The Chronicles of Rus" chronicles the turbulent events of Ruthen history.
-Natalya Dragunova - Known for her thought-provoking literary essays and insightful social commentary in her book "Reflections of the Silent Steppes."

These authors, among many others, contribute to the rich tapestry of Ruthen literature, capturing the spirit, resilience, and deep-rooted traditions of the Ruthen people. Their works serve as a testament to the enduring cultural legacy that continues to shape the literary landscape of Ruthenia.

## Pytaris

![The Ancient Ruins of Pyta, the old capital](https://gyazo.com/f47a36056712bb04949f03f41c6cf2c6)

Nestled across the towering peaks of the Mavren mountains, Pytharis stands as the cultural nucleus of the Near Lands. With an air of exoticism and a penchant for philosophical pursuits, Pytharis has long been revered as the wellspring of art, culture, and intellectual exploration. While it has never sought dominance, Pytharis has consistently played a vital role as the agricultural powerhouse of Tellus throughout recorded history.

Situated between the ever-rivaling powers of Doria and Turcia, Pytharis has been a coveted economic hub and a hotly contested territory for countless generations. Even during the tumultuous years of the War, Pytharis's attempts at maintaining neutrality proved futile, as armies marched across its lands, planting flags only to be displaced by the opposing forces soon after.

The Black Day, with its devastating effects, spared much of Pytharis from its direct wrath. This fortunate circumstance granted Pytharis a significant advantage in warding off the encroachments of Turcia, resulting in a fragile balance that has held precariously for the past three decades.

### Pytarks at a Glance

![A family in the Pytar countryside](https://cdn.midjourney.com/05195016-a4d4-467e-81dd-5c32c832e69f/0_1.png)

**The silence of Le Vides:**

Pytharis is home to the ancient and revered temples of Le Vides, which were once vibrant centers of spiritual devotion. However, in the wake of The Black Day, these temples have fallen into a mysterious silence, their sacred rites and rituals abandoned. The profound stillness that envelops these sacred sites now hints at a forgotten legacy.

**The Network:**

Renowned for their astute intelligence operations, Pytharis boasts the finest network of spies in all of Tellus. These clandestine operatives, shrouded in secrecy, gather intelligence and disseminate information with unparalleled precision. Whispers of Pytharian spies weaving their web of intrigue echo throughout the realms, their allegiances and motives remaining enigmatic to most.

**The Golden Princes:**

Ruling over Pytharis are a series of merchant princes, each vying for supremacy through the art of economics. These shrewd and cunning individuals manipulate markets, amass wealth, and wield their influence to shape the destiny of Pytharis. The city-state becomes a labyrinthine arena of economic rivalries and power struggles, where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye.

**Songs of Legend:**

The people of Pytharis are renowned for their exceptional skills in dance and entertainment. Gifted with a natural flair for captivating performances, they captivate audiences with their grace, fluidity, and unparalleled artistry. Pytharian dancers and entertainers are highly sought after in noble courts across Tellus, their mesmerizing displays of talent adding a touch of elegance and splendor to grand festivities and celebrations."

## The Lands Beyond the Empire

### Turcia: The Land of Living Gods

![The Bright City of Sahr sees no Conflict with the Old and New](https://cdn.midjourney.com/b51d3ab4-c1c0-49f1-a150-2e21bb94e51f/0_3_384_N.webp)

A land steeped in history, Turcia has seen various forms of governance throughout its existence. From being ruled by nomadic steppe warriors to an empire with a complex social structure, it has evolved over time. In the past five centuries, Turcia has embraced a theocratic system, with a singular figure known as the Golden Lord holding dominion over the land.

The enigmatic presence of the Golden Lord first emerges in written records around the early 470s BBD. Unlike rulers with spouses or successors, the Golden Lord has defied mortality, remaining a solitary figure with no apparent heirs. Revered as a descendant or embodiment of the divine entity Makru, the Golden Lord has ushered in a golden age for Turcia, coinciding with the decline and disappearance of the Vardan Empire. The favor of the gods seems to have bestowed its blessings upon the land of the Turci.

However, unsettling rumors have started to circulate within the court, casting doubt on the fate of the Golden Lord. For over six decades, no written accounts of the Lord have been recorded, fueling speculation that he may be deceased or absent. Despite this uncertainty, Turcia has managed to maintain internal order and even expand its borders during this time. The implications of the Lord's absence or demise remain uncertain, and Pytharis, in the neighboring Far Lands, watches with a sense of cautious optimism, grateful for the respite from potential turmoil. The fate of Turcia hangs in the balance, awaiting the revelation of the truth and the subsequent course of events.

![Turcik families often work within the state together](https://cdn.midjourney.com/106ec9a9-f589-4606-8f72-2532728a5161/0_2.png)

One of the remarkable phenomena in Turcicus is the occurrence of children born with mesmerizing purple eyes. These rare individuals are believed to be blessed by Makru, the deity associated with the Golden Lord. Recognized as a sign of divine favor, these children are sought out by the servants of the Golden Lord, who take them under their wing for special training and tutelage.

Slavery, although legal in Turcicus, carries certain unique aspects that distinguish it from common practices elsewhere. While slaves exist within the society, they possess certain rights that allow them to purchase their own freedom. The ability to buy one's freedom is a recognized path for slaves to regain their autonomy and become free citizens. However, it is important to note that slavery is not hereditary, and the children of slaves do not inherit their parents' enslaved status. Nevertheless, familial debt can lead to the enslavement of a family, emphasizing the interconnectedness of economic and social factors in Turcicus.

In the complex tapestry of beliefs within Turcicus, there exists a cult devoted to the worship of the enigmatic Midnight Lady, regarded by its followers as the counterpart or companion of the Golden Lord. Members of this clandestine group engage in secretive practices, including assassinations and impersonations of officials to manipulate the country's affairs according to their beliefs. The influence exerted by the cult adds a layer of intrigue and unpredictability to the already intricate power dynamics within Turcicus.

Beyond its religious and political intricacies, the Turci people themselves exhibit a distinct and endearing trait of openness and curiosity about the wider world. They eagerly welcome travelers and storytellers, valuing the exchange of knowledge and experiences. The Turci people's genuine interest prompts them to offer hospitality and often compensate individuals for sharing tales and information, further fostering a culture of dialogue and storytelling within their society.

### Suomi

![A Suomi villiage is often only lived in every 4-6 months of the year](https://cdn.midjourney.com/b6870f28-fc7d-4a3b-8a1b-1d952ef41ad9/0_0_384_N.webp)

Deep in the northern reaches of Tellus, where the rugged mountains embrace the eternal snow, resides the resilient and proud Suomi people. Their ancestral roots run deep, and their migratory patterns span the vast taiga, moving from north to south with the changing seasons. Embodying a spirit of freedom and strength, the Suomi have cultivated a warrior culture that permeates every aspect of their lives.

Guided by the Tursakkaanen of Vuorus, their venerable shamans perform sacred rituals, offering bountiful sacrifices of food, goods, and life to the divine forces they revere. Among the Suomi, it is customary for the second-born children to embark on journeys to the south, their inheritance structure intricately linked to the eldest siblings. These brave Suomaran individuals often find themselves serving as elite mercenaries, celebrated in countless bardic tales for their towering stature and unwavering courage.

The Suomi people are organized into eighteen tribes, each led by a Joht (Lord) and Noaidi (Shaman). Together, these thirty-six individuals form the esteemed Althing, a governing body responsible for establishing laws and resolving disputes between the tribes. Within their ranks, the Vuorenuja hold a special status, bestowed upon elder Noaidi who have communed with the gods themselves. Recognized as wise visionaries, they possess the privilege to cast tie-breaking votes during Althing gatherings, ensuring the resolution of important matters.

The Suomi's indomitable spirit, steadfast traditions, and sacred rituals rooted in nature have shaped them into a resilient and honorable people. Their unwavering curiosity and openness to the world have made them eager listeners and passionate conversationalists, often valuing knowledge and information enough to offer generous rewards or extend warm hospitality in exchange for engaging conversations.

![Fishing if often one of best ways to attain food in these cold lands](https://cdn.midjourney.com/7af2537b-7725-4f83-b09c-bff62634f073/0_0_384_N.webp)

Nestled amidst the majestic peaks of Aventhorn, the sacred mountains where the Tursakkaanen reside, lies a pivotal rite of passage for all leaders and heroes of the Suomi people. Aspiring individuals must embark on a treacherous climb, ascending to the heights where the frozen air bites and the gods' presence is palpable. It is here, amidst the icy winds and unforgiving terrain, that visions of the divine may be granted. Those who survive this perilous journey often emerge forever changed, claiming to hear the whispers of their gods directly, a lifelong connection forged in the solitude of the mountain peaks.

Within Suomi society, both men and women share a dedication to physical prowess and endurance. Annually, as the world awakens from the winter's grasp, the Suomi gather for vibrant spring games. These spirited competitions become a testament to their strength and skill, with participants undertaking extraordinary feats to showcase their might. These contests serve not only as demonstrations of physical prowess but also as a celebration of communal unity and shared determination.

The revered Shamans of the Suomi hold a position of great influence and spiritual guidance within the community. Often acting as conduits between the mortal realm and the divine, these wise practitioners may send specific children on extraordinary voyages as commanded by their gods. Endowed with a sacred purpose, these young adventurers embark on journeys of self-discovery, often encountering great trials and revelations. Upon their return, they are met with honor and respect, taking their rightful place as esteemed members of their tribe, entrusted with preserving ancestral wisdom and traditions.

Deeply rooted in a communal ethos, the Suomi extend their hospitality to strangers, offering them shelter and sustenance as a matter of cultural practice. The spirit of brotherhood and unity permeates their gatherings, where great feasts are shared, stories are woven, and bonds are forged. However, it is crucial to note that the Suomi possess a formidable sense of justice, and when wronged, their peaceful demeanor can transform into swift and resolute action, unleashing their innate capacity for violence in defense of what they hold dear.

The Suomi people, marked by their sacred mountain rituals, physical prowess, and deep communal ties, embody a profound connection with their gods and the natural world around them. Their unwavering hospitality is an extension of their belief in the interconnectedness of all beings, fostering an atmosphere of camaraderie and shared experiences that have shaped the Suomi into a resilient and noble society.

### Kemet

Nestled amidst the enigmatic lands of the Black River, Kemet stands as a testament to the ancient heritage that predates the memories of most. Monuments and structures, hallowed by time, bear witness to a glorious past that has influenced and inspired countless empires and kingdoms throughout the ages.

However, the grandeur of bygone eras has slowly waned, and Kemet has experienced a prolonged decline. Once a global powerhouse, it gradually receded into a regional dominion, ultimately becoming an isolated kingdom along the banks of the Black River. A succession of inept and mediocre rulers contributed to this downward trajectory, leading to courtly isolation and a reluctance to embrace technological advancements. These factors left Kemet vulnerable to external influences, casting a shadow over its former glory.

The opportunistic Dorians seized this moment of vulnerability, employing military campaigns and occupying Kemet to establish their control over the court and civil systems. Despite their dominance, they dared not depose the revered Pharaohs, whose sacred status and cultural influence held immense sway over the people. Thus, a delicate balance emerged, with the Dorians reigning over Kemet while cautiously avoiding a mass rebellion.

However, with the fall of Doria, a home to call upon in times of need no longer existed for the people of Kemet. In this critical juncture, a young and ambitious Pharaoh named Shafra-Ab has taken it upon himself to rally his forces and expel the Dorians from their ancestral lands. Sensing the impending threat, the Dorians have tightened their grip, strategically funneling expatriate groups from Doria into the kingdom, in a bid to perpetuate their dominance and preserve their hold on power.

Kemet, once the cradle of ancient wisdom and profound civilization, now finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with the shadows of its past and the uncertainties of its future. The fate of the kingdom hangs in the balance as the Pharaoh Shafra-Ab embarks on a daring quest to reclaim Kemet's sovereignty, while the Dorians endeavor to consolidate their control over a land that teeters on the precipice of change. The echoes of an ancient civilization resound within Kemet, and the unfolding chapters of its history will determine whether it shall rise from the ashes of decline or succumb to the tides of fate.

Within the borders of Kemet, a land steeped in ancient mystique, a brutal apartheid state has taken root, forged by the Dorians' iron fist. The subjugated Kemet populace, who dare to challenge their oppressors, face the dire consequences of death or enslavement. The pervasive system of discrimination casts a dark shadow over the kingdom, perpetuating a cycle of fear and oppression.

Deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of the Kemet people is their reverence for the Black River, which they perceive as the lifeblood of the earth itself. The river's flowing waters hold immense spiritual significance, symbolizing the eternal connection between the land, its people, and the divine forces that govern their existence. The Black River weaves through their myths, rituals, and daily lives, serving as a source of inspiration and awe.

Scattered across the vast expanse of Kemet are ancient temples, remnants of a time preceding the rise of other kingdoms. These sacred structures, shrouded in enigma and laced with curses, stand as testaments to a forgotten era. These sites of worship, abandoned by gods and haunted by the spirits of bygone civilizations, serve as a stark reminder of the profound mysteries and deep history that permeate the land.

In spite of their own hardships and destitution, the people of Kemet embody a spirit of generosity and hospitality. Rooted in customs that span thousands of years, they offer what little they possess to those in need, embodying the enduring principles of their ancient culture. However, this noble virtue can occasionally lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, as certain habits or remarks may inadvertently offend their sensibilities, causing tensions to arise.

Within the tapestry of Kemet's existence, a complex interplay of suffering, resilience, and ancient customs unfolds. The apartheid state inflicted by the Dorians casts a shadow over the land, while the people draw strength from their reverence for the Black River and navigate the remnants of long-forgotten temples. The spirit of generosity, despite the hardships faced, remains a guiding principle, even as cultural sensitivities and ancient customs shape the interactions and dynamics within Kemet. The destiny of this ancient kingdom, with its deep-rooted traditions and turbulent history, hangs in the balance as the struggle for liberation and cultural preservation continues to unfold.

### Beithar

In the distant northeast reaches of Tellus, sprawling across vast flat plains, the proud Yoruba people make their home. Guided by the ebb and flow of their nomadic lifestyle, they traverse the open grasslands with their majestic herds of horses, seeking fertile pastures and new horizons. The Yoruba suB Continent extends its influence to the neighboring lands that border the remnants of old Doria and the resolute Suomi. These lands have witnessed the Yoruba's alternating fortunes, as rival powers seize the opportunities when the Yoruba are divided and suffer the consequences when they reunite under a formidable Tarkhan.

This age-old cycle of dominance and unity has persisted for thousands of years. A Tarkhan emerges, leading the Yoruba tribes to conquest and territorial expansion, while the border towns serve as living testament to the cyclical nature of Yoruban dominance. Their customs, traits, and even language blend seamlessly with Yoruba culture. The swift act of kneeling in reverence and submission to a newly proclaimed Tarkhan carries profound meaning, symbolizing the acknowledgment of an unstoppable force that will lay waste to all obstacles in its path.

For centuries, the empire played a delicate game of manipulation and appeasement with the Yoruba hordes, seeking to avoid direct conflict and instead offering incentives to maintain a semblance of stability. However, with the dissolution of the empire and the rise of the charismatic Yoruban prince, Bataar, the tides of fate have cast an unseen die. The fate of the Yoruba and their role in shaping the future of Tellusnow hangs in the balance. Should Bataar successfully rally the fragmented tribes and unite their collective strength, the Yoruba will emerge as the most formidable force in the realm, potentially heralding a new era of Yoruban ascendancy and reshaping the political landscape of Tellus.

Deep within the cultural tapestry of the Yoruba people, a profound tradition known as "memory songs" weaves the threads of their collective memory. Through the magical power of singing, the Yoruba possess the ability to transfer memories and wisdom across generations. Elder members of the community utilize their melodic voices to imbue their stories, experiences, and knowledge into the minds of the younger ones. This ancient practice serves as a bridge connecting the past with the present, preserving the ancestral heritage and ensuring that the lessons of their forebears are carried forward.

From a tender age, the Yoruba children are initiated into the art of horsemanship and the intricacies of working from the backs of their majestic Steppe Rams. These imposing creatures, adorned with magnificent horns, hold a place of utmost significance in Yoruba culture. They provide not only transportation and labor but also a deep spiritual connection between the Yoruba and the land they traverse. The symbiotic relationship between the Yoruba and their Steppe Rams is nurtured through a bond built on trust, respect, and mutual reliance.

In the realm of warfare and hunting, the Yoruba display their prowess with the atlatl—a hooked implement utilized to propel javelins across vast distances, sometimes exceeding hundreds of yards. This ancient projectile weapon, honed to perfection by generations of Yoruban warriors, serves as a testament to their precision and skill. While the Yoruba have embraced firearms in their interactions with outsiders, their traditional weapons, including the atlatl, remain the preferred choice when engaging in battles or pursuing their traditional way of life.

Integrity and honesty are held in the highest regard among the Yoruba, for their legends recount the dire consequences awaiting those who engage in deception. Their moral compass is rooted in a profound belief in justice and the afterlife, where deceptive souls are destined to face terrible punishments. This cultural ethos of unflinching honesty permeates the fabric of Yoruban society, shaping their interactions and engendering trust and transparency among their people.

The Yoruba, with their time-honored memory songs, mastery of horsemanship, prowess in ancient weaponry, and unwavering commitment to truth, stand as a formidable force, both revered and respected within the realm of Tellus. Their rich cultural heritage and unyielding principles continue to guide them, as they navigate the ever-shifting tides of history and strive to shape their own destiny in the vast expanse of the world.

# The Great War and the Black Day

The Great War erupted with a cataclysmic clash between the formidable nations of Doria and Carantia. Tensions between the two had simmered for years, fueled by territorial disputes, political maneuvering, and a deep-rooted sense of national pride. The spark that ignited the powder keg came in the form of an assassination, an act that would forever alter the course of history.

As the war unfolded, Ruthenia and Hellas found themselves on the sidelines, initially maintaining a stance of neutrality. Ruthenia, a nation known for its fertile lands and agricultural prowess, sought to shield its resources from the ravages of war. Hellas, embroiled in its own bitter conflict with the expansionist nation of Turcicus, had its attention divided, grappling with the pressures of defending its borders and preserving its sovereignty.

The cunning strategists of Doria recognized an opportunity to tip the scales in their favor. By declaring war on Turcicus, they enticed Hellas into joining their cause. Hellas, burdened by the ongoing hostilities with Turcicus and enticed by the promises of favorable post-war agreements, reluctantly acquiesced to Doria's call for aid. The once-neutral Hellas was thrust into the maelstrom of war, its fate irrevocably intertwined with that of Doria.

Carantia, its princes driven by its thirst for dominion, sought to expand its influence and reshape the geopolitical landscape. Recognizing the vulnerability of Ruthenia, Carantia employed coercive tactics to force its involvement in the war. They threatened to sever the vital trade routes that sustained Ruthenia's food stores, unleashing the specter of famine upon the nation. Ruthenia, faced with the dire choice between submission or starvation, reluctantly succumbed to Carantia's demands, becoming embroiled in the conflict against its will.

Years of ruinous warfare ensued, marked by a relentless cycle of destruction and despair. Both Doria and Carantia, fueled by their belief in their own righteousness and the desire to dominate their adversaries, unleashed the full force of their military and technological might. It was during this time that the concept of Esoteria emerged as a potent weapon.

Esoteria, the fusion of industrial innovation and arcane magic, represented a revolutionary advancement in the art of war. Scholars, engineers, and magicians collaborated to develop a new breed of devastating weaponry. Enchanted artillery shells obliterated entire battalions, armored constructs bolstered the frontlines, and protective barriers defied conventional assault. The harnessing of magic in conjunction with industrial machinery brought forth unprecedented levels of destruction and loss.

However, amidst the grim stalemate and the horrors of trench warfare, a breakthrough came in the form of airborne warfare. Airships, colossal vessels propelled by enchanted engines and armed with potent weaponry, soared above the desolate battlefields. These floating behemoths defied the constraints of the land and provided a means to bypass the entrenched defenses.

The introduction of airships heralded a new era of warfare. Rapid advancements in aerial technology allowed for strategic bombardments, swift troop deployments, and unprecedented mobility. The war-torn skies became a theater of high-stakes battles, with daring pilots and crews engaged in deadly dogfights, dropping devastating payloads upon enemy positions.

The culmination of these advancements and strategic maneuvers led to the fateful Siege of Varranthal, a pivotal event that would forever change the course of the war. The city of Varranthal, a symbol of power and strategic importance, became the focal point of a relentless assault. Both sides poured vast resources and unleashed the full potential of Esoteria in a desperate bid to secure victory.

It was on "The Black Day," the climax of the siege, that an unimaginable catastrophe occurred. Something went awry, shrouding the city of Varranthal in a malevolent force known as the Murk. The Murk manifested as an otherworldly phenomenon, devouring everything in its path and leaving only desolation in its wake. The city, its inhabitants, and the armies locked in combat were consumed by this enigmatic darkness.

The Murk, an ever-expanding abyss devoid of life, proved inscrutable and implacable. Despite extensive investigations and attempts to discern its nature, no bones, remains, or tangible evidence of the vanished souls were ever recovered. The Murk became an enduring enigma, a haunting reminder of the unspeakable tragedy that unfolded on that ominous day.

In the aftermath of the cataclysm, the shattered nations were left reeling, their populations decimated, and their once-proud cities reduced to mere ruins. The Black Day marked the definitive end of the Great War, not through a decisive victory, but through the collective realization of the irreparable devastation wrought upon Tellus. Leaders, generals, and soldiers perished in the Murk, their ambitions and dreams forever extinguished.

The world emerged from the crucible of war forever scarred, its nations forever changed. The Great War and the Black Day became indelible chapters in history, serving as a somber reminder of the catastrophic consequences of unchecked conflict, the dangers of escalating technology, and the relentless pursuit of power. The scars of the past would shape the future, as the survivors grappled with the challenges of reconstruction, healing, and the ever-present specter of the Murk that loomed as a reminder of the price paid for their hubris.

## The Charred One

**Creeds**

- All shall be consumed by fire, but the last shall be the arsonists.

- Death is not to be feared but embraced; it is a gift granted to the weak, an escape from the dying world.

- Destruction holds an inherent beauty, an exquisite form of expression.

\*\*Holy Days

- The Red Day - May 6th: Commemorating the anniversary of the devastating Gavo firestorm and the birth of their god.

- Herald's Day - August 31st: Observing the anniversary of The Black Day, a significant event in their history.

- The period between The Red Day and Herald's Day is known as Brenndauer, a time when the followers of the Charred One are called to be most active, stoking the flames of their mad pursuit.

No grand temples stand in honor of the Charred One, nor do intentional monuments proclaim their existence. Their monuments are the scorched remnants of cities, and their temples lie within the ruins left by others. In the aftermath of the Great War, those who survived faced a choice: to rebuild or to revel in the ashes of what once stood.

The birth of the Charred One came from the desolation of Gavo, a city ravaged by a cataclysmic firestorm in the year 3 BBD. It emerged silently, calling out to those filled with grief, trauma, and madness.

Followers of the Charred One encounter no tolerance for their beliefs within established cities or towns. Instead, they gather in abandoned places, congregating in the shadows before spreading to the farthest reaches of Tellus to fulfill the will of their deranged deity.

The Charred believe in the ultimate unmaking of all creation, and they employ any means necessary to bring about its destruction. Through manipulation, intrigue, assassination, and incitement of unrest, they seek to ignite the world in chaos. They take particular pleasure in obliterating ancient structures and monuments, for in their destruction, not only the present is ruined but also all potential futures are erased.

### The Burning Congregation

Followers of the Charred One operate in a clandestine and covert manner, reminiscent of terroristic cells or cults. They are driven by their dark devotion to destruction, chaos, and the ultimate annihilation of all creation. Their actions are marked by ruthlessness, secrecy, and a willingness to employ any means necessary to further their cause.

Acting as agents of terror, the followers of the Charred One execute acts of violence, sabotage, and manipulation to sow fear and chaos within society. They target symbols of stability, authority, and ancient structures, relishing in the destruction that erases not only the present but also all potential futures. Their acts range from arson and assassination to incitement of unrest and manipulation of power dynamics.

Recruitment of new members is a delicate and secretive process. The followers of the Charred One seek out individuals who exhibit signs of grief, trauma, and madness, drawing them towards the allure of the destructive deity. They identify those disillusioned with the established order, seeking purpose and an outlet for their deep-seated pain. Through subtle manipulation, the followers gradually expose these individuals to the ideologies and rituals of the Charred One, enticing them with promises of power, release from fear, and the ecstasy of destruction.

Recruitment efforts primarily occur in abandoned places and hidden gatherings, away from the prying eyes of society. Potential recruits are approached individually, tested for their resilience, and gradually introduced to the twisted beliefs and practices of the cult. The followers of the Charred One exploit their vulnerabilities, amplifying their fears and anguishes, ultimately offering them a sense of purpose and belonging within the cult's dark embrace.

The recruitment process involves indoctrination through rituals, rites, and teachings that reinforce the notions of destruction, chaos, and the beauty found in annihilation. New members are gradually initiated into the cult's inner circle, where they are assigned mentors to guide them in the dark arts, imparting knowledge of fire manipulation, subterfuge, and the secrets of the Charred One's doctrines.

Trust and loyalty are paramount among the followers, as betrayal is met with severe consequences. The cult operates with strict secrecy, ensuring that their activities remain hidden from the eyes of authority. Members communicate through encrypted channels and secret symbols, using coded language to avoid detection. This secretive nature ensures that the followers remain elusive, striking fear into the hearts of those who would stand against them.

### Ranks of The Charred

At the pinnacle of the hierarchy, the Infernal Chosen are the supreme leaders and enigmatic figures of the Charred One's followers. These individuals have undergone a transformation granted by the Charred One, their forms altered by the consuming flames of their devotion.

The Infernal Chosen possess immense knowledge of the Charred One's rituals and doctrines and wield great influence over the cult-like cells operating under their command.

**Flamebranders:**
The Flamebranders are the trusted lieutenants of the Infernal Chosen, chosen for their exceptional commitment to the cause and their mastery of destructive arts. These fanatical zealots have undergone a lesser transformation, their bodies partially consumed by fire, leaving them with charred skin and smoldering appendages. They are responsible for organizing and leading small cells of followers, executing acts of destruction, and spreading fear and chaos in the name of the Charred One.

**Ashmancers:**
The Ashmancers are the initiates who have proved their dedication and willingness to embrace the Charred One's destructive path. They are skilled practitioners of dark arts and wielders of flame. These followers have undergone a transformative process that manifests as smoky tendrils coiling around their limbs, granting them a heightened resistance to fire and the ability to summon and manipulate flames. Ashmancers are responsible for recruiting new members, conducting rituals, and performing acts of terror and destruction.

**Embersworn:**
Embersworn are the foot soldiers and frontline warriors of the Charred One's followers. They have pledged their lives to the cause and receive minor physical alterations, such as scorch marks on their flesh and eyes glowing with a faint fiery aura.

They serve as the muscle and enforcers within the cells, ensuring obedience and punishing any signs of wavering loyalty.

**Flamebound:**
The Flamebound are the lowest ranks of the Charred One's followers. They have recently joined the cult and have yet to undergo significant transformations. However, their devotion to the Charred One is unquestionable, and they strive to prove their loyalty and ascend the ranks. Flamebound are tasked with gathering information, reconnaissance, and recruitment of potential followers. They are the entry point into the cult-like cells and are closely monitored by higher-ranking members.

### Sins

**Betrayal of Secrets:** Revealing the hidden rituals, doctrines, or identities of fellow cult members or the inner workings of the Charred One's operations to outsiders is considered a grave transgression. It undermines the cult's secrecy and puts its members at risk.

**Failure to Execute Destructive Acts:** Followers of the Charred One are expected to actively contribute to the cause of destruction and chaos. Failing to carry out assigned acts of violence, sabotage, or manipulation is seen as a betrayal of their commitment to the deity and his teachings.

**Sympathy for Preservation:** Showing empathy or compassion towards the preservation of life, stability, or ancient structures contradicts the fundamental beliefs of the cult. Any expression of sentiment or reluctance towards embracing the annihilation and eradication advocated by the Charred One is seen as a serious transgression.

**Disobedience to Superiors:** Defying the commands or orders given by higher-ranking members within the cult hierarchy is considered a transgression. The followers of the Charred One operate with a strict chain of command, and any act of disobedience disrupts the unity and effectiveness of their destructive efforts.

**Collaboration with Opposing Forces:** Engaging in alliances, collaborations, or cooperations with individuals or groups that are actively opposing or obstructing the goals of the Charred One is seen as a betrayal. The cult expects absolute loyalty and allegiance to its cause, leaving no room for compromise or cooperation with those who stand against them.

**Doubt or Questioning:** Expressing doubt or questioning the teachings, ideologies, or actions of the Charred One is viewed as a transgression against the cult's core beliefs. Followers are expected to have unwavering faith and conviction in the path of destruction and chaos set forth by their deity.

**Failure to Initiate New Recruits:** Each member of the cult is entrusted with the task of recruiting and expanding their ranks. Failing to actively seek out and initiate new followers is considered a transgression. It hinders the growth and influence of the cult, impeding its ability to further the cause of destruction and spread chaos.

**Revealing Personal Weaknesses:** Sharing personal vulnerabilities or weaknesses with outsiders or fellow cult members is seen as a transgression against the cult's ethos. Followers are expected to present a unified front, projecting strength, and embracing the power that comes from the destruction they seek.

---

### Atonement

Atonement for transgressions within the cult of the Charred One is a complex and arduous process, as the deity and his followers embrace destruction and chaos rather than traditional notions of repentance. However, there are some ways in which a follower can seek to regain favor and mitigate the consequences of their transgressions:

**Offering Greater Destruction:** One way to atone is to demonstrate an intensified commitment to the cause of destruction and chaos. The follower must engage in acts of unparalleled devastation, surpassing their previous actions and proving their dedication to the Charred One's principles. By causing widespread mayhem and furthering the cult's goals, they can strive to redeem themselves.

**Sacrificial Rituals:** Followers can partake in sacrificial rituals where they offer something significant to appease the Charred One and seek forgiveness. This might involve sacrificing a cherished possession, enduring physical pain, or even offering the lives of others to demonstrate their devotion and willingness to make amends.

**Undertaking a Trial by Fire:** A follower seeking atonement may undergo a trial by fire, a grueling test of their loyalty and commitment. This could involve enduring physical or psychological challenges, walking through flames, or subjecting themselves to extreme environments or situations associated with fire and destruction. Success in the trial signifies purification and potential forgiveness.

**Completing a Mission of Destruction:** The follower can be assigned a specific mission or task by the cult's leadership, designed to showcase their renewed dedication and loyalty. By successfully executing this mission, causing significant destruction or sowing chaos, they can demonstrate their remorse and willingness to make amends for their transgressions.

**Reaffirming Allegiance through Rituals:** Participating in intense and elaborate rituals can serve as acts of atonement. These rituals may involve self-flagellation, enduring pain or hardship, or engaging in acts symbolizing destruction and rebirth. Through these rituals, the follower reinforces their commitment to the Charred One and seeks purification from their past failures.

It's important to note that forgiveness within the cult of the Charred One is not easily granted. Atonement is a demanding and ongoing process that requires extreme dedication, unwavering loyalty, and a continuous pursuit of destruction. Even if a follower manages to atone for their transgressions, the memory of their past actions may linger, and they may always be viewed with caution and scrutiny by their fellow cult members.

Far to the North, the Tursakkaanen observe the world from their perch atop Mount Avrenthorn. They uphold an ancient system of laws and rituals passed down by the shamans and holy seers of the icy steppe.

While they do not actively interfere in the affairs of mankind, they exert influence upon those who are willing to listen to their timeless wisdom. Pilgrims who embark upon the arduous journey to the summit of the towering mountains may experience the resounding voices of the Nine echoing within their minds. The words are spoken slowly, spanning years to complete.

The followers of the Tursakkaanen, known as the Listeners, choose to surrender themselves to the currents of fate and the guidance of their own thoughts. They extend their consciousness beyond the present moment, immersing themselves in the ancient chants and sacred utterances of their deities. This communion allows them to become vessels of fate. A Listener often finds themselves in precisely the right place at the right time, although they may endure suffering as a consequence of their serendipity.

The Listeners are generally welcomed but met with some distrust among people from various corners of the world. Their tendency to also embody the roles of vagabonds, thieves, or humble individuals relegates them to the lower echelons of society within urban areas.

### The Listeners

The followers of the Tursakkaanen, known as the Listeners, operate with a sense of purpose and devotion deeply rooted in their guiding principles. They perceive the world as an indifferent entity and believe in surrendering themselves to the currents of fate. The Listeners act with a certain level of detachment, recognizing that pleasure and pain are inherent aspects of human existence.

The Listeners lead a nomadic lifestyle, wandering through various lands and rarely gathering outside of Suomi Lands. They can often be seen working closely with tribal leaders in the northern regions, forging alliances and offering their unique insights. However, in other parts of the world, the Listeners may appear as vagabonds, blending into the lower echelons of society.

Recruitment of new members into the Tursakkaanen is an organic process driven by personal experiences and revelations. Potential recruits are often individuals who have shown a proclivity for seeking deeper truths and contemplating the workings of the world. They may encounter Listeners during their own journeys or chance encounters, where the Listeners share their timeless wisdom and insights. Those who resonate with the philosophy and beliefs of the Tursakkaanen may choose to join their ranks voluntarily.

The Listeners value introspection and self-discovery, encouraging new members to embark on personal quests and pilgrimages to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. They believe in the power of experience and direct revelation, as well as the resounding voices of the Nine that echo within the minds of the faithful. Listeners may guide and mentor new members, helping them navigate the complexities of their newfound spiritual path.

The Listeners prioritize the preservation of their ancient laws, rituals, and wisdom. They rely on oral traditions and sacred chants passed down through generations, keeping their beliefs alive through the recitation of ancient texts and the performance of rituals. Listeners engage in deep communion with their deities, seeking guidance and enlightenment from the voices that resonate within them.

Overall, the Listeners operate with a sense of humility, embracing their role as vessels of fate. They strive to live in harmony with the world and its natural rhythms, while offering their wisdom and guidance to those who are open to receiving it. The actions of the Listeners are guided by their unique understanding of the interconnectedness of fate, power, cold, life, and death, and their desire to navigate the currents of existence with grace and insight.

### The 5 Ranks of Nine

**Elder Seers:** The Elder Seers are the highest-ranking individuals within the Tursakkaanen hierarchy. They are the most experienced and wise Listeners who have spent a lifetime communing with the Nine and receiving their timeless wisdom. Elder Seers are revered as the ultimate authorities and spiritual leaders among the Listeners.

**Tribal Liaisons:** These are Listeners who have earned the trust and respect of the tribal leaders in the northern regions where the Tursakkaanen frequently operate. They act as intermediaries between the Listeners and the tribal communities, facilitating cooperation and mutual understanding. Tribal Liaisons often possess deep knowledge of tribal customs, rituals, and traditions, serving as a bridge between the Tursakkaanen and the indigenous people.

**Sacred Scribes:** The Sacred Scribes are skilled individuals among the Listeners who possess the ability to transcribe and interpret the sacred chants, rituals, and prophecies of the Tursakkaanen. They meticulously record the ancient wisdom bestowed upon them by the Nine and ensure the preservation of their sacred texts. Sacred Scribes play a crucial role in maintaining the collective knowledge and spiritual traditions of the Listeners.

**Ritual Guardians:** Ritual Guardians are entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the sacred rituals, artifacts, and places of worship of the Tursakkaanen. They are skilled in the intricacies of the ritualistic practices and act as protectors of the Listeners' spiritual heritage. Ritual Guardians are also responsible for conducting ceremonies, guiding the faithful, and maintaining the sanctity of the sacred sites.

**Seekers of Fate:** Seekers of Fate are Listeners who have embarked on a personal journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. They undertake arduous quests and pilgrimages to distant lands, seeking to expand their understanding of the world and strengthen their connection with the Nine. Seekers of Fate often bear distinctive ritualistic tattoos, each with a unique name symbolizing their personal quest or revelation. These tattoos serve as marks of distinction and recognition within the hierarchy.

It is worth noting that the hierarchy within the Tursakkaanen is fluid and flexible due to their wandering nature and decentralized structure. Authority and influence are often earned through wisdom, experience, and the respect garnered from both the Listeners themselves and the tribal communities with whom they interact. The ritualistic tattoos carried by the Seekers of Fate serve as visual indicators of their station and accomplishments within the hierarchy, symbolizing their spiritual growth and journey toward enlightenment.

### Sins

**Disregarding the Sacred Chants:** The Tursakkaanen place great importance on their ancient chants and sacred texts. A follower who deliberately disregards or disrespects these sacred rituals and fails to participate in the communal recitation of the chants commits a significant transgression.
Rejecting the Guidance of the Nine: The Nine voices that echo within the minds of the Listeners are considered a divine gift and a source of profound wisdom. A follower who intentionally ignores or rejects the guidance and insights offered by these voices goes against the core principles of the Tursakkaanen and commits a transgression.

**Acting Against the Natural Order:** The Tursakkaanen hold a deep reverence for the natural world and the interconnectedness of all beings. A follower who deliberately engages in actions that disrupt or harm the delicate balance of nature, such as wanton destruction of flora or fauna or exploitation of natural resources without regard for sustainability, commits a transgression against the teachings of the Tursakkaanen.

**Betraying the Trust of Fellow Listeners:** The Listeners form a tight-knit community built on trust and shared experiences. A follower who intentionally betrays the trust of their fellow Listeners, engages in deceit, or reveals sacred knowledge to those outside the faith commits a serious transgression that undermines the unity and integrity of the Tursakkaanen.

**Refusing Personal Growth and Self-Reflection:** The Tursakkaanen emphasize personal introspection and the pursuit of self-discovery. A follower who stubbornly resists personal growth, fails to engage in self-reflection, or rejects opportunities for spiritual development and understanding commits a transgression against the principles of the Tursakkaanen.

**Disrupting Sacred Ceremonies or Rituals:** The Tursakkaanen hold their ceremonies and rituals as sacred and integral to their faith. A follower who intentionally disrupts or disrespects these ceremonies, whether through interruption, mockery, or inappropriate behavior, commits a transgression that dishonors the traditions and beliefs of the Tursakkaanen.

**Failing to Uphold the Values of Serenity and Detachment:** The Tursakkaanen believe in embracing the world with serenity and accepting the currents of fate. A follower who consistently acts with anger, aggression, or seeks personal gain at the expense of others violates the values of the Tursakkaanen and commits a transgression against the peaceful and detached nature they strive to embody.

It is important to note that the Tursakkaanen view transgressions as opportunities for growth and redemption. They believe in the power of self-reflection, repentance, and seeking forgiveness from the Nine and the community of Listeners. A follower who recognizes their transgressions, seeks atonement, and actively works towards rectifying their actions can find a path to redemption within the faith of the Tursakkaanen.

**Integration and Redemption:** Atonement is a continuous process, and the follower must integrate their lessons and growth into their daily life. By living in accordance with the teachings of the Tursakkaanen and consistently demonstrating positive change, the follower can find redemption and restore their standing within the Tursakkaanen community.

The guidance and support of spiritual leaders and the acceptance of the community are crucial factors in the journey of atonement for a follower of the Tursakkaanen.

# Novemgrod, Setting the Stage

The Mist Cliffs of Novemgrod stand as a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of its inhabitants. Situated on the western edge of the Eastern Shelf, this once-thriving city found itself on the precipice of oblivion when the Murk engulfed its surroundings, leaving only two sides exposed to the enigmatic mist. In the wake of such a devastating catastrophe, the survival of Novemgrod hinged upon the unwavering dedication of the builder's guilds.

Faced with the imminent threat of dissolution, the skilled craftsmen and women of Novemgrod's builder's guilds rallied together, laboring tirelessly for weeks on end. Their collective efforts were focused on salvaging what remained of the city, fortifying its structures, and shoring up the foundations against the encroaching mist. It was through their unwavering determination and unwavering spirit that Novemgrod managed to withstand the relentless onslaught of the Murk, emerging as a beacon of hope amidst the chaos.

While the city may have lost many of its historical quarters to the relentless advance of the mist, fragments of its glorious past still linger. Among the remnants, the legendary Palatine Regium, an ancient stronghold and castle dating back to the bygone era of the Imperium, stands as a proud testament to Novemgrod's storied history. This architectural marvel, though weathered by time and the encroaching mist, stands as a poignant symbol of the city's enduring spirit.

The transformation brought about by the Murktide has given rise to a unique and awe-inspiring architectural landscape within Novemgrod. The clash between the absurdist architecture, born out of necessity and the urgency of rebuilding, and the few remaining ancient spires creates a surreal juxtaposition. The cityscape becomes a tapestry of grandiose impressions and resolute desperation, where the ingenuity of the builders merges with the echoes of a glorious past.

The shifting nature of the Murktide imposes a constant challenge upon the inhabitants of Novemgrod. As the mist ebbs and flows, several teams of dedicated workers swiftly move to fortify and reinforce the foundations of the western plazas. Their tireless efforts, undertaken with a sense of urgency and purpose, are essential in safeguarding the city against the relentless onslaught of the encroaching mist. With each shift of the Murktide, the fate of Novemgrod hangs in the balance, and the resilience of its people is put to the test.

In the face of adversity, Novemgrod stands as a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the unwavering determination to forge a future amidst the encroaching darkness. The Mist Cliffs, with their mixture of survivalist architecture and ancient remnants, serve as a haunting reminder of the fragility of existence and the relentless march of time. Yet, within the mist-shrouded city, a glimmer of hope persists, as the people of Novemgrod continue to defy the odds and write their own tale of resilience and survival in the shadow of the Murk.

## Nobles, Bereft of Nobility

Destined to be an unlikely ruler, Ruvan's path to becoming the Grand Prince was fraught with challenges and disapproval. His own uncle, Milov, held disdain for him throughout his life, belittling him with harsh words of being too soft and ignorant of the world. These disparaging remarks echoed in Ruvan's ears during his formative years, a constant reminder of his perceived inadequacies.

The shadow of comparison loomed over Ruvan, particularly in relation to his cousin Rikov, a valiant prince known for his prowess in battle. Rikov, two years Ruvan's senior, possessed the qualities of bravery and physical prowess that were esteemed in their society. While the two shared a genuine friendship outside the confines of court, Rikov never truly grasped the depths of Ruvan's bookish and delicate nature. As fate would have it, Ruvan's path seemed destined for a life of administration, a role befitting his scholarly inclinations.

However, the onset of The War changed everything. Milov and Rikov departed Novemgrod, leaving Ruvan to govern in their absence as they rallied their armies and Magisters to confront the impending threat from the West. Tragically, they never returned, leaving Ruvan to inherit a shattered homeland and the weighty responsibility of rebuilding in the shadow of his heroic family.

Despite his youth, Ruvan proved to be a wise and discerning ruler. Surrounded by knowledgeable advisors, he exhibited a disregard for the corrupt machinations of the Councils, instead prioritizing the welfare of his subjects. In essence, he embodied the ideals of an enlightened despot, although at times, his determination and inclination towards micromanagement led him down a path of stubbornness. Trusting only a select few among his fellow nobles, Ruvan maintained a cautious proximity to them, aware that a palace coup could be brewing at any moment. While he appeared physically frail, his gaze betrayed a profound insight that seemed to transcend the mortal realm.

In times of need, Ruvan sought the counsel of High Magister Valeska, a relationship built on politeness and friendship. Their interactions served a mutual purpose: the Magister relied on Ruvan for survival, while he sought her guidance in matters of esoteric knowledge. Perhaps something deeper existed between them, a connection that surpassed their respective stations, but the constraints of their roles prevented any further union. Nonetheless, they conversed as kindred spirits, individuals left behind by their more formidable and foolish predecessors, navigating a world that demanded their wisdom and resilience.

## The Cries of Salvation

The echoes of diverse faiths resound through the bustling streets of Novemgrod, a metropolitan center within a larger cosmopolitan region. Within this vibrant tapestry of beliefs, different religions coexist and collaborate while simultaneously engaging in a constant competition for the souls of the populace. It is important to note that these overlapping faiths do not necessarily exclude one another, and grand acts of charity, benevolence, and even "miracles" performed by rival clergy are not uncommon occurrences, each seeking to capture the attention and devotion of the masses.

Generally speaking, the interfaith rivalry remains peaceful, though not always entirely fair. Instances where a miracle is thwarted by a servant of a competing faith may elicit indignation and scorn, yet rarely does this verbal conflict escalate into physical violence. However, an exception to this norm exists in the form of secretive cults that emerge to worship and draw power from the enigmatic Murk and its enigmatic inhabitants. Whispers of nocturnal rituals at the edge of the city persist, though the identities of those involved are veiled in mystery. Furthermore, certain gods are deemed unwelcome in the light of day, such as the ominous Charred One and the enigmatic Apatur. Despite lacking an overt following on paper, intrigue and suffering continue to afflict the city, leaving a lingering sense of unease.

With the exception of the aforementioned cases, the majority of faiths denounce The Murk and its creators, the Magisters. Prior to The War, religious leaders perceived themselves as the sole guardians against the growing power of the Magisters and their imposing Spires. They criticized those who dabbled in Esoteria, viewing their practices as audacious attempts to breach the divine realm and attain godhood themselves.

The calamitous downfall of the Magisters and the subsequent Cataclysm only served to validate the concerns of the faiths. As a result, anyone practicing Esoteria is often met with censure within religious circles, if not outright excommunication, rendering them social outcasts. It is only due to the Magisters' indispensable role in maintaining the vast sea of mist that envelops the city that they have been spared from the torches of religious fervor thus far, for their continued involvement remains a necessity, albeit a begrudging one.

## Towers and Magisters

Perched upon the smoldering remnants of a city she once cherished in her youth, High Magister Valeska II finds herself entangled in a web of complex emotions and daunting responsibilities. Born into poverty as the daughter of a humble practitioner of rudimentary Esoteria, Valeska embarked on a relentless ascent through the ranks of the Magisterial order, fueled by her unwavering determination and meticulous approach.

Despite achieving the esteemed status of Magister and unlocking the coveted Sixth Seal, Valeska encountered an insurmountable barrier that prevented her from ascending to the ranks of the nobility. The entrenched power of the old bloodlines that permeated the spires conspired against this newcomer, obstructing any path to upward mobility for the Novus Homo. However, fate intervened, and three fortuitous circumstances saved Valeska from a life of mediocrity.

Firstly, her exceptional aptitude for Esoteria set her apart as one of the most gifted practitioners of her generation, affording her unparalleled access to the arcane arts. This remarkable talent, combined with her sharp political acumen, caught the attention of Grand Prince Milov of Novemgrod.

Recognizing her unique blend of cunning and raw power, Milov interceded on her behalf, beseeching the Council to grant her opportunities commensurate with her abilities. Moreover, it was the Council's prejudiced rejection and disdain for the "outsider" that inadvertently spared Valeska's life.

Elevated to a position within the Council, Valeska found herself unwittingly excluded from their grand plan to secure victory in The War. She wept bitter tears upon realizing she would not share in the glory of their triumph. However, the tides of fortune shifted abruptly with The Calamity, turning her perceived loss into both a hollow victory and an inescapable burden.

As the blame for the catastrophe fell squarely upon the shoulders of the Council, the populace directed their ire towards Valeska, the now High Magister. Were it not for the intervention of Prince Ruvan, she would have likely faced condemnation and punishment, consigned to the unforgiving depths of The Murk as retribution for the council's egregious hubris.

Now, Valeska presides over a decaying system, perched atop a fragile throne of authority. Her loyal Magisters toil tirelessly, their efforts dedicated to upholding the weakening wards and safeguarding the remnants of the city and its beleaguered inhabitants. Yet, concealed both within the city's boundaries and amidst the alabaster walls of The Spire, clandestine movements fester, plotting to enact a radical transformation of the prevailing regime. The burden resting upon Valeska's shoulders is immeasurable, for all bear witness to the Council's role in precipitating the great Calamity, and no act can absolve them of their collective guilt.

## Woe of the Commons

The soldier, the farmer, and the factory worker—these stalwart individuals have weathered the trials and tribulations of the past three decades with a resilient determination. Their unwavering resolve to forge a better life for themselves and their loved ones has been met with relentless obstacles imposed by higher powers. In the eyes of princes and high priests, the lives of ten common people hold little significance when weighed against the grand struggles of nations and souls. What price must be paid for the happiness of orphans and the destitute amidst the machinations of power?

Nevertheless, they persist, day in and day out, toiling ceaselessly, brick by brick, as the unsung architects of a new world. It is they who bear the burden of rebuilding, even when their efforts are exploited by their superiors, for whom their plight often goes unnoticed. Blinded by their entourage of counselors, princes fail to perceive the struggles of the common folk. While the churches offer assistance, they exact a spiritual toll, demanding adherence to rituals and beliefs. In the aftermath of the war, many have lost faith, although their deep-seated superstitions remain entrenched. The mention of Esoteria—the forbidden realm of forbidden knowledge—is deemed taboo at most dinner tables, alongside the contentious topic of politics. Both subjects have claimed the lives of their sons, brothers, and fathers, and the resentments borne from these losses shall remain until death claims them.

Yet amidst their collective hardships, a flickering ember of hope endures within their hearts. They cherish the noble aspirations that reside within them, safeguarding their dreams even as they harbor skepticism. Their spirits may be wounded, but the indomitable spirit of resilience remains, a testament to their unwavering determination to preserve their dignity and seek justice. For within the unyielding resolve of these unsung heroes lies the potential for change, a silent rebellion against the forces that have sought to subjugate them. Though their voices may not always be heard, their silent struggle continues, a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

## Rising Opportunists

Driven to the brink by the absence of legal avenues for survival and upward mobility, a significant portion of the lower classes finds solace in the embrace of criminality. Organized crime syndicates and gangs weave their intricate webs of influence, entrenching themselves within the fabric of almost every neighborhood in the sprawling expanse of major cities. Astonishingly, a few of these criminal entities have even been granted official recognition by the ruling elite, trading the semblance of legitimacy in exchange for maintaining a semblance of order within the city's confines.

Simultaneously, another contingent of society seeks refuge in the realm of Freelancery, gravitating towards the ranks of mercenary companies or even forming their own. Comprising veterans of The War, these groups are veiled in the guise of professional soldiers but often bear an uncanny resemblance to hired brigands. When challenges emerge that cannot be openly addressed by the Princes or their courtiers, they reluctantly turn to these costly yet expendable factions, entrusting them with the delicate task of resolving matters discreetly, away from the prying eyes of the public.

The rise of these alternative paths is a testament to the fraying social fabric and the erosion of trust in traditional systems of governance. Faced with limited opportunities for legal advancement or fair treatment, individuals from the lower echelons of society have been compelled to venture into the shadowy realms of organized crime or embrace the precarious life of a hired sword. Their choices reflect a profound disillusionment with the prevailing social order, where the rule of law fails to provide equitable opportunities and those in power turn a blind eye to the struggles of the marginalized. It is a stark reminder of the systemic inequalities that continue to plague the realm, pushing its inhabitants to seek unconventional means of survival and justice in a world that has failed them.

## What Lies Ahead?

The future of Novemgrod hangs precariously in the balance, as uncertainty shrouds the city in an aura of mystery and apprehension. Whispers of clandestine cults, their dark rituals concealed in the cloak of night, permeate the outskirts, adding an air of eerie intrigue to the already tumultuous atmosphere. Meanwhile, the diligent delvers, braving the treacherous remnants of the fallen city, unearth cryptic artifacts and relics that hint at forgotten secrets and hidden truths.

Both the Prince and the High Magister, the pillars of authority in Novemgrod, cling to power with a tenuous grip, unaware of the fragility of their positions. Their threads of control are worn thin, susceptible to unforeseen forces that lurk in the shadows, poised to unravel the very fabric of their rule. The Prince, burdened with the weight of his family's heroic legacy, faces the constant struggle to assert his authority and navigate the intricate webs of court intrigue. Meanwhile, the High Magister, Valeska, finds herself in a position of immense responsibility, burdened not only by the crumbling remnants of a broken system but also by the knowledge of the Council's complicity in the calamity that befell the city.

In this climate of uncertainty and vulnerability, the destiny of Novemgrod hangs in the balance. Will the secrets whispered in the dark bring about salvation or damnation? Can the delvers' discoveries hold the key to uncovering the city's hidden past and shaping its future? As the Prince and the High Magister teeter on the edge of their authority, unaware of the forces conspiring against them, the threads that bind Novemgrod's fate together grow ever thinner. The outcome of these tangled events remains elusive, leaving the city and its inhabitants teetering on the precipice of a destiny yet to be revealed.

## Notable Faces

### Prince Ruvan

Prince Ruvan, a figure marked by both resilience and vulnerability, carries a backstory that weaves together strands of longing, determination, and unexpected grace. Born into the noble lineage of Novemgrod, Ruvan's path to power was riddled with challenges and insecurities. His early years were shadowed by the disapproval of his uncle, Milov, who dismissed him as "soft" and lacking worldly knowledge. This constant comparison to his brave and esteemed cousin, Rikov, only deepened Ruvan's feelings of inadequacy.

Physically, Ruvan stands at an average height, his frame stocky and strong from soldiering these last decades. His fair complexion bears the faint remnants of childhood illnesses and adult hardships, which left him marked and scarred in appearance. Yet behind his seemingly frail exterior lies a gaze that reveals an otherworldly insight, hinting at a depth of wisdom and resilience that surpasses his 40 years.

Despite his physical limitations, Ruvan possesses an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a penchant for intellectual pursuits. While his cousin Rikov thrived in the realm of battle, Ruvan found solace within the pages of philosophy and fiction. He immersed himself in the works of great thinkers, seeking refuge in the realms of imagination and introspection.

When The War erupted, fate thrust Ruvan into an unforeseen role. Milov and Rikov, the pillars of his family, entrusted him with the responsibility of leading Novemgrod while they amassed their armies. However, their absence would become permanent, leaving Ruvan to inherit the shattered remains of his home and the daunting task of rebuilding in the shadow of his heroic lineage.

In the face of adversity, Ruvan proved himself a wise and compassionate ruler. He surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors, valuing their counsel over the corrupt machinations of the Councils. Despite his youthful appearance, Ruvan exhibited a tenacious resolve, venturing into the realm of micromanagement to ensure the well-being of his subjects.

To seek guidance in matters of esoteric nature, Ruvan often sought the company of High Magister Valeska. Their meetings were characterized by a polite and amicable demeanor, borne out of the mutual understanding that their fates were intertwined. The unspoken connection between them, though stifled by their respective stations, hinted at a shared sense of being abandoned by their predecessors and a shared longing for redemption.

Amidst the turmoil that plagues Novemgrod, Ruvan remains a beacon of hope and resilience for his people. His frailty belies a profound strength of character, and his unwavering determination to navigate the treacherous currents of power and rebuild a shattered world fuels the whispers of a brighter future in the hearts of his subjects.

### The High Magister Valeska

High Magister Valeska, a figure shrouded in enigma and tempered by adversity, bears a backstory that intertwines elements of resilience, ambition, and a deep connection to the arcane arts. From humble beginnings, Valeska's journey into the realm of magic was both an escape and a means to transcend her circumstances.

Born into a modest family in the outskirts of Novemgrod, Valeska's early years were marked by poverty and struggle. Her father, a rudimentary Esoterist, instilled in her a fascination with the mystical and the arcane. It was through her father's guidance and her own innate talent that she discovered her affinity for manipulating the forces of Esoteria.

Valeska's appearance is striking and beguiling, with flowing raven-black hair that cascades down her back like a midnight waterfall. Her piercing, almond-shaped eyes possess an ethereal quality, their vibrant blue hue often shimmering with a hint of secrets and hidden knowledge. Adorned in flowing robes of deep indigo, she carries an aura of both authority and mystery, her presence commanding attention and respect.

In her pursuit of arcane mastery, Valeska dedicated countless hours to honing her skills and unraveling the complexities of Esoteria. Her relentless determination and thirst for knowledge led her to ascend the ranks of the Magisterial order, even in the face of prejudice and opposition from the old bloods that clung to the traditional hierarchy.

However, her ascent was not without its share of sacrifices. As Valeska unlocked the Sixth Seal, a potent symbol of her mastery over Esoteria, she found herself barred from attaining nobility, a privilege reserved for those born into the old bloodlines. This injustice fueled her ambition, driving her to prove herself worthy of recognition and respect.

It was Grand Prince Milov of Novemgrod who recognized Valeska's political acumen and unparalleled magical prowess. He saw in her the ideal combination of cunning and raw power required to navigate the treacherous corridors of power. Impressed by her abilities, he implored the Council to grant her a seat, elevating her to the esteemed position of High Magister.

As High Magister, Valeska stands at the precipice of a creaking and failing system, shouldering the weight of both responsibility and blame. Her days are filled with tireless efforts to keep the wards intact, preserving what remains of the city and its inhabitants. Many within and outside the alabaster walls of The Spire, disillusioned by the actions of the Council and the Spire itself, secretly conspire for regime change, placing Valeska in a precarious position where her every move is scrutinized.

In her private moments, Valeska often retreats to her study, surrounded by ancient tomes and arcane artifacts. There, she delves into the mysteries of forbidden knowledge, seeking insights and solutions to the challenges that beset Novemgrod. Her unwavering dedication to her craft is matched only by her desire to atone for the sins of the Council and find redemption for their hubris that led to The Calamity.

Haunted by the betrayal of her former allies, Valeska treads a delicate path, knowing that the trust of the populace hangs in the balance. She carries within her a burning desire to reshape the city, to forge a future where the mistakes of the past are not repeated, and where her mastery of Esoteria can be channeled toward the betterment of Novemgrod.

### Victor Volkov

Victor Volkov, widely known as "The Vors," is a formidable figure who holds significant influence over the city of Novemgrod. Born into the underbelly of the city, Victor's upbringing was marked by poverty and violence. As a young man, he quickly learned that survival in this harsh environment required a certain ruthlessness and cunning. With a sharp mind and a natural talent for strategic thinking, Victor rose through the ranks of the criminal underworld, establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with.

In appearance, Victor cuts an imposing figure. Standing tall and broad-shouldered, he exudes an air of authority and confidence. His dark, piercing eyes seem to hold the weight of the secrets he carries, and a permanent five o'clock shadow adds to his mysterious allure. Victor's strong jawline and rugged features give him an aura of rugged charm, though his cold and calculating demeanor serves as a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beneath his charismatic exterior.

Known for his shrewd business acumen, Victor has managed to extend his influence beyond traditional criminal activities. Understanding the power dynamics of Novemgrod, he has taken control of the city's security, effectively becoming the manager of the royal guard. While The Stroidan, his loyal gang, engages in extortion and other illicit activities, Victor ensures that they maintain a delicate balance of power, preventing outright chaos and ensuring relative peace on the streets. Despite his criminal activities, he maintains a certain code of honor within his organization, punishing those who overstep boundaries and providing a sense of security for the citizens who would otherwise be left vulnerable.

Beyond his criminal empire, Victor possesses a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the city's power dynamics. He carefully navigates the complex political landscape, forging alliances and manipulating key players to further his own interests. While his actions may seem self-serving, Victor believes that he is the true guardian of Novemgrod, protecting it from internal and external threats in his own ruthless way.

However, despite his power and influence, Victor remains a mysterious and enigmatic figure. His true motivations and long-term goals are known only to a select few, and his actions often leave those around him questioning their loyalties. His ability to inspire fear and command respect has made him a figure of both admiration and trepidation, and many wonder if there is more to Victor Volkov than meets the eye.

With the loss of her parents, she found herself alone and vulnerable in a world shattered by chaos. Stripped of her familial support, she was forced to navigate the harsh realities of life in a workcamp, where she witnessed firsthand the cruelty and injustice endured by the less fortunate.

Growing up in the workcamp, Erika became acutely aware of the stark divide between the privileged and the oppressed. The daily struggles, meager living conditions, and backbreaking labor shaped her perception of the world and fueled a burning desire for change.

Erika's journey from orphanhood to becoming a prominent union agitator and community leader is a testament to her resilience and unwavering commitment to justice. Her experiences in the workcamp not only shaped her understanding of the oppressive systems at play but also fueled her determination to dismantle them. Erika's childhood hardships became the driving force behind her tireless efforts to fight for the rights and dignity of the working class, leaving an indelible mark on the city of Novemgrod.

### Elsbeth Von Bergmann

Elsbeth was born into the aristocratic Von Bergmann family, renowned for their wealth and influence in the region. However, tragedy struck her at a young age when her parents succumbed to a fatal illness during an outbreak that swept through the city. Left orphaned and alone, Elsbeth's life took a dramatic turn.

Without any close relatives to take her in, Elsbeth was placed under the care of a distant relative who showed little interest in her well-being. Faced with neglect and mistreatment, she found solace in the confines of her family's expansive library. It was within those walls that Elsbeth discovered a love for knowledge and an insatiable thirst for learning.

Despite her circumstances, Elsbeth's natural intelligence and determination shone through. She dedicated herself to her studies, devouring books on a wide range of subjects, from history and philosophy to politics and economics. This thirst for knowledge became her driving force, empowering her to rise above her difficult circumstances.

As Elsbeth grew older, she became increasingly aware of the social and economic disparities that plagued her city.

## Notable Factions

### The Stroidan

The Stroidan, a notorious criminal network that operates in the shadows of Novemgrod, is a clandestine organization renowned for its intricate web of criminal activities and its iron grip on the city's underworld. Born out of the chaos and lawlessness that followed The Black Day, this network has grown to become a formidable force, exerting its influence on every aspect of the city's criminal landscape.

The Stroidan operates with meticulous precision and unwavering ruthlessness. They have established a vast network of skilled criminals, informants, and corrupt officials who help maintain their stranglehold on the city. Under the cover of darkness, The Stroidan orchestrates a wide range of illicit activities, including smuggling, extortion, drug trafficking, and assassination.

One of the key figures within The Stroidan is Viktor Volkov, a cunning and ruthless crime lord who commands respect and fear from both his subordinates and rival factions. Viktor has established his dominance by capitalizing on the weakened state of the city's law enforcement, as the royal guard has been unable to replenish its ranks. He has taken over the security operations in Novemgrod, providing protection to businesses and residents in exchange for a hefty fee. While his gang may engage in extortion and other criminal acts, they also play a role in maintaining a fragile semblance of order in the city, preventing total anarchy from taking hold.

The Stroidan thrives on secrecy and operates through a complex system of codes, hidden symbols, and covert communication channels. Its members wear black veils or masks, obscuring their identities and adding an air of mystique to their criminal activities. This secrecy allows the organization to evade the prying eyes of the authorities and maintain control over their illicit operations.

Within the criminal network, there are various specialized divisions, each with their own area of expertise. These divisions include skilled thieves, master forgers, talented assassins, and adept hackers. The Stroidan prides itself on recruiting individuals with unique skills and exceptional abilities, ensuring that they have a competitive edge over rival criminal organizations and law enforcement agencies.

While The Stroidan operates primarily for its own gain, it is not uncommon for them to strike deals or form temporary alliances with other criminal groups or corrupt officials to further their influence and protect their interests. They have a reputation for being swift and merciless in dealing with those who betray their trust or attempt to undermine their operations.

The true extent of The Stroidan's influence and power remains a mystery to most, as their activities are shrouded in darkness and secrecy. Their vast network extends far beyond the borders of Novemgrod, infiltrating neighboring cities and regions, making them a force to be reckoned with in the criminal underworld.

The Stroidan represents a constant threat to the fragile stability of Novemgrod, with their activities undermining the efforts of law-abiding citizens and posing challenges to the authorities. The Prince and other key figures in the city must tread carefully, aware that The Stroidan's reach extends into the highest echelons of power. Unmasking and dismantling this criminal network is a formidable task that requires unwavering determination and strategic cunning.

### The Bannerless

The Bannerless, born from the ashes of The Great War, was founded as a chaptered organization by veterans who had witnessed the devastating consequences of conflict. Recognizing the need for stability and unity across the warring kingdoms, these brave individuals banded together to form a formidable force dedicated to upholding peace and safeguarding the innocent.

In its early days, the primary objective of The Bannerless was to bridge the divides between the factions and ensure lasting stability. The founding members understood that by uniting the soldiers who had fought on opposite sides, they could foster understanding, heal wounds, and forge a path towards reconciliation. Their aim was to create a new era marked by cooperation and mutual respect.

As the war ended three decades ago, many of the original founders have now passed on the mantle to the next generation. The legacy of The Bannerless runs deep within their bloodlines, and the children of these esteemed veterans have been inducted into the chapters. Guided by the wisdom and experiences of their parents, they continue the noble mission, carrying the torch of unity and justice forward.

Each chapter within The Bannerless possesses a distinct identity, shaped by the city in which it resides. These identities are a reflection of the unique cultures, customs, and challenges that each city faces. However, despite these individual characteristics, all members of The Bannerless welcome one another with open arms. Bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood are forged across cities and regions, fostering a spirit of camaraderie, respect, and shared purpose.
While the chapters maintain their own local operations and initiatives, they remain united under the banner of The Bannerless. Regular gatherings, training sessions, and exchange programs are held to foster a sense of unity and to ensure that members benefit from the collective knowledge and experiences of their peers.

The Bannerless's strength lies not only in the diverse skills and expertise of its members but also in the solidarity and mutual support they offer one another. Members from different chapters often come together to tackle larger threats that transcend city boundaries, drawing on their collective resources and knowledge to face challenges with a united front.

As The Bannerless continues to evolve and expand, its influence and impact spread across the realms. The organization's commitment to stability, justice, and peace resonates deeply within its members and extends to the communities they serve.

### The Foundation

The Foundation, a mysterious organization that resides in the shadows, has garnered its fair share of critics who claim that there is more to it than meets the eye. While publicly presenting themselves as an esteemed group of intellectuals and scholars, their detractors argue that The Foundation conceals a darker agenda beneath its façade of enlightenment.

At the helm of this clandestine organization are a group of disenchanted nobles, who may outwardly serve Prince Ruvan but harbor a deep dissatisfaction with his rule. These individuals, yearning for greater influence and power, find solace within the folds of The Foundation. It is here that they convene, sharing their discontent and plotting their own clandestine endeavors.

Central to The Foundation's operations is their private library, meticulously curated to house a vast collection of Esoteria. This secretive repository serves as a gathering place for the members, granting them exclusive access to ancient and forbidden knowledge. Within the hallowed halls of the library, esoteric texts and artifacts are preserved and studied, delving into the realms of magic, mysticism, and the occult.

However, The Foundation's activities extend beyond the pursuit of esoteric knowledge. While they engage in philanthropic efforts that are seemingly driven by a desire to uplift the community, their true motivations lie in achieving ulterior goals. Behind the veil of charitable endeavors, they strategically deploy their resources and influence to manipulate situations to their advantage. These acts of philanthropy serve as a means to gain favor, influence key individuals, or secure crucial alliances necessary for their hidden agendas.
The Foundation's true intentions and the extent of their actions remain shrouded in secrecy. Whispers among the populace hint at their involvement in covert operations, political maneuverings, and even darker rituals. Critics allege that The Foundation's pursuit of power and control surpasses their professed commitment to enlightenment and progress.

While some may view The Foundation as a beacon of knowledge and intellectual prowess, others regard it with suspicion and fear. They question the true nature of this organization, wary of the hidden forces that may be at play behind closed doors. As rumors swirl and dissenting voices grow louder, The Foundation's grip on the shadows tightens, concealing their true motives and leaving the populace to wonder what machinations lie beneath their enlightened facade.

### Temnovus

Deep in the shadows of Novemgrad, a mysterious and clandestine group known as the Temnovus thrives, shrouded in secrecy and darkness. Their members remain elusive and hidden, their identities veiled behind a web of intrigue and anonymity. No one knows for certain who is part of this enigmatic organization, as they operate with utmost discretion, silently moving through the city's corridors undetected.

The Temnovus, driven by an insatiable fascination with the dark, have left their mark upon the city's landscape. From time to time, their symbol emerges, painted in cryptic patterns upon public areas. It serves as a chilling reminder of their presence, an invitation to those who dare to seek the secrets they hold. Yet, it is not only in public displays that their symbol manifests. In the depths of hidden chambers and forsaken corners, the Temnovus conducts their dark rituals, invoking forces beyond comprehension. Authorities stumble upon these eerie symbols, evidence of the Temnovus' sinister practices, fueling speculation and fear.

Rumors abound that the Temnovus worships The Murk, an entity shrouded in mystique and darkness. Some believe that the cult channels the very power of The Murk, drawing upon its enigmatic energy for their own purposes. The Murk's association with chaos and the unknown instills a sense of unease in the hearts of the people, further fueling the suspicion surrounding the Temnovus.

Despite being strictly forbidden in Novemgrad, the allure of the Temnovus persists. The city's authorities have waged a relentless battle to suppress their activities, but their efforts have met limited success. Symbols of the Temnovus continue to materialize in unexpected places, a silent defiance against the established order. And people, unfortunate souls, occasionally vanish without a trace, their disappearances seemingly linked to the enigmatic cult.

In the darkness of night, the Temnovus thrives, weaving its web of secrets and manipulating the unseen forces that dwell within the shadows. Novemgrad remains a city plagued by the lingering presence of this forbidden cult, its symbol a haunting reminder of their existence, and the uncertainty of what lies hidden in the depths of their twisted devotion.

## Notable Locations

### The Forges

Nestled amidst the remnants of the Great War factories, The Forges stand as a testament to the enduring spirit of Novemgrod's workforce. Once bustling centers of mass production, these factories now serve as a combined residential and industrial hub for thousands of workers who call them home.

Within the dilapidated walls of The Forges, a unique system has taken root. Failed magisters, those who couldn't ascend to the noble ranks of their order, find employment as enchanters, infusing specialist items with magical properties. Despite their lack of recognition in the esteemed Magisterial hierarchy, these individuals possess a deep understanding of esoteria and use their skills to create enchantments that give an edge to weapons, armor, and various other survival tools.

The Forges have become a vital source of essential materials necessary for survival in Novemgrod. Workers toil day and night, producing weapons, ammunition, and other supplies needed to protect themselves in the ever-uncertain world beyond the city's walls. The clanging of hammers and the rhythmic pounding of the forge reverberate through the air, serving as a constant reminder of the industriousness that fuels the city's survival.

While the factories themselves may be the lifeblood of the city, they are not under the direct control of the government or the ruling class. Instead, a single committee of wealthy individuals has taken charge of running The Forges. These influential figures, driven by their own self-interest, exploit the labor of the workers for personal gain. They pay exorbitant sums to The Stroidan, a powerful criminal organization, to ensure the populace remains compliant and the factories remain operational.

However, the working conditions within The Forges are far from ideal. The pursuit of profit takes precedence over the safety and well-being of the workers. The factories are plagued by neglect, with outdated equipment and crumbling infrastructure. Industrial accidents are a grim reality, and tragic deaths occur on a weekly basis. Workers risk their lives daily in hazardous environments, where inadequate safety measures and lack of proper training contribute to the alarming rate of accidents.

Despite the dangers, the workers of The Forges continue their labor, driven by necessity and the hope for a better future. Their resilience and determination to provide for their families and survive in a harsh world are unmatched. The industrial district becomes a place of both struggle and camaraderie, where solidarity among the workers is born out of shared hardships.

Within The Forges, whispers of discontent and calls for better working conditions grow louder. Unions and activists emerge, seeking to agitate for change and improve the lives of the workers. Their efforts, however, are met with resistance from the committee and their hired enforcers from The Stroidan, who protect the interests of the wealthy elite at the expense of the workers' well-being.

The Forges, with its sprawling factories and the pervasive presence of The Stroidan, stands as a stark symbol of the harsh realities faced by the working class in Novemgrod. It is a place where hope and desperation intertwine, where lives are lost amidst the clatter of machinery, and where the struggle for survival unfolds against a backdrop of industrial oppression.

### The Mist Cliffs

Nestled on the outskirts of Novemgrod, the Mist Cliffs stand as a haunting testament to the catastrophic events of the Black Day. As the earth trembled and shifted, a large section of the city plunged several hundred feet into the depths of the Murk, forever altering the landscape. The remnants of revered temples and grand architectural marvels now lay submerged below the ominous line of the Mist Cliffs, their former glory obscured by the murky abyss.

Despite the dangers that lurk within the depths, a brave and intrepid group known as the Divers emerges. These explorers, as the locals call them, accept the treacherous task of descending the Mist Cliffs to retrieve the lost artifacts and remnants of a bygone era. Equipped with specialized gear and harnesses, they navigate the precipitous edges, suspended by cranes that dangle precariously over the chasm. The Divers face constant peril as they maneuver through the swirling mist, their every movement a battle against the unknown.

The Mist Cliffs hold an eerie allure, a place where the boundary between the mortal realm and the Murk becomes blurred. Standing near the edge, one may sense a palpable presence, a ghostly touch that sends shivers down the spine. As the thick mist envelops the surroundings, subtle shapes and shadows emerge from the depths, their forms indiscernible yet undeniably otherworldly. Whispers drift through the air, echoing from unseen sources, their words lost in an incomprehensible language. Only those who have stood at the precipice for too long can attest to the unsettling sensation of being watched by unseen eyes.

The Mist Cliffs serve as a constant reminder of the profound tragedy that befell Novemgrod on the Black Day. Yet, they also beckon to the adventurous souls who are willing to risk their lives in search of lost relics and fragments of history. The mist-clad expanse conceals untold secrets, waiting to be unearthed by the courageous Divers who dare to descend into the depths. As they embark on their perilous journeys, the Mist Cliffs remain a testament to the city's enduring spirit and the enigmatic mysteries that lie within the ever-present embrace of the Murk.

### The Umbralith Halls

In the dark and foreboding depths beneath the towering cliffs of Novemgrod lies a sinister network of mines, infamous for their association with the dreaded umbraliths. These mines, once ordinary passages of rock and earth, have been transformed into treacherous domains of raw magical energy, giving birth to the malevolent substance known as umbralite.

For generations, the rulers of Novemgrod have exploited these cursed mines to harvest umbralite, a resource of immense power but also unspeakable danger. The demand for umbralite in arcane experiments, dark rituals, and the crafting of powerful artifacts has driven the city's leaders to desperate measures, including the forced labor of prisoners.

Convicts deemed unworthy of redemption or those who dared defy the city's harsh laws are condemned to toil in the umbralite mines. Shackled and stripped of their freedoms, these prisoners descend into the depths of darkness, where the very essence of magic permeates the air with an ominous aura.

The horrors that await the prisoners in the umbralite mines are beyond description. The unnatural energies emanating from the umbralith formations warp reality itself, twisting the minds and bodies of those unfortunate enough to be exposed. Many prisoners succumb to madness or physical deformities, their screams echoing through the labyrinthine tunnels as they are consumed by the dark forces at play.

The work is ceaseless and grueling, with prisoners forced to extract umbralite shards from the heart of the umbraliths using crude tools and minimal protection. The unstable nature of umbralite makes each strike of the pickaxe a gamble with death, as volatile reactions and magical surges can claim lives in an instant.

Those who survive the mines often emerge as hollow shells of their former selves, their bodies scarred by the harsh conditions and their souls tainted by the corrupting influence of umbralite. Yet, even in their broken state, they are driven by the desperate hope of earning a meager reprieve or fleeting moments of respite from their nightmarish existence.

The umbralite mines of Novemgrod stand as a grim reminder of the depths to which humanity can sink in pursuit of power and wealth, a haunting testament to the sacrifices made in the name of dark ambitions.

### St. Vikal's Cathedrals

The St. Vikals Cathedral, once a revered symbol of worship and spirituality in Novemgrod, now stands as a solemn reminder of a bygone era. In the days before the Black Day, Le Vides reigned as a primary deity, his presence deeply woven into the fabric of the city's religious and cultural identity. The grand Cathedral, with its towering spires and intricate carvings, served as a sacred haven where devoted followers sought solace and guidance.

However, on that fateful day, as chaos and destruction descended upon Novemgrod, the priests of Le Vides noticed an unsettling silence in their prayers. The absence of the god's divine presence reverberated not only throughout the city but across the entire realm of Ereb. Speculations abound, with some believing that Le Vides has forsaken the people, while others entertain the possibility of the god's demise amidst the cataclysmic events of the Black Day.

Over the years, the once-vibrant Cathedral gradually fell into disrepair and abandonment. Its hallowed halls, once filled with the harmonious echoes of worship, now bear witness to the footsteps of the desperate and unhinged who seek refuge within its weathered walls. Among them, the Penitient Choir emerged—a faith born from the void left by Le Vides' absence. They took ownership of a portion of the Cathedral, utilizing it for their modest acts of worship, while the remaining areas now serve as a sanctuary for countless refugees displaced by the aftermath of the Black Day.

As one approaches the St. Vikals Cathedral, the grandeur of its Gothic architecture commands attention. The structure rises majestically, its stone façade adorned with intricate gargoyles and stained glass windows that, although faded and cracked, still bear fragments of their former brilliance. The towering spires reach towards the heavens, an enduring testament to the devotion and craftsmanship of the builders who erected this sacred edifice. Inside, the atmosphere is a mixture of reverence and desolation, as the faint scent of incense lingers amidst the echoes of distant footsteps. The flickering candlelight casts dancing shadows upon the worn pews, and the air carries a sense of longing and spiritual yearning that mingles with the heavy weight of uncertainty.

## Exploring Novemgrod

Novemgrod, in its post-Black Day state, presents a labyrinthine challenge to those who dare to navigate its streets. The city's rebuilding efforts, though commendable, have resulted in a patchwork of confusing thoroughfares. Streets abruptly end at fallen structures, leading to dead ends that bewilder even the most seasoned residents. In this maze of reconstructed chaos, street names have become mere whispers, replaced by the colloquial monikers known only to the locals. Novemgrod, therefore, remains a perplexing and disorienting place for all who venture through its convoluted pathways.

The city is divided into distinct districts, each with its own character and challenges. The Hollowed Quarter, positioned adjacent to the ever-menacing Murk, bears witness to the relentless encroachment of the Murktide during its tumultuous surges. Few individuals permanently reside in these desolate ruins, for it is a place haunted by shadows and uncertainty. However, whispers spread of an underground tunnel network that weaves through the Hollowed Quarter, serving as a lifeline for those who still call this forsaken place their home.

On the precipice of the Mistcliffs lies Cliffwall, a neighborhood defined by its proximity to both the ethereal mists and the city's neglect. It becomes a refuge for those unable to afford a safer abode elsewhere. In this district, peculiar occurrences abound, a result of the confluence between the ever-looming presence of the Murk and the absence of proper security. The denizens of Cliffwall endure a precarious existence, navigating the treacherous boundaries of the unknown.

The Palace District, although stripped of its opulence, still retains a regal air, serving as the enduring symbol of power and authority. While the buildings here have been stripped of their once-ornate gold and precious materials to aid in the city's reconstruction, the district remains a well-organized bastion of governance. It is within these hallowed grounds that Prince Ruvan strives to maintain his grasp on the remnants of his city, making calculated decisions that shape the fate of Novemgrod.

To the west lies WestWard, the pulsating heart of industry and the home of the Forge. This bustling district resonates with the incessant rhythm of hammer upon anvil, as skilled craftsmen and laborers toil ceaselessly to produce the materials essential for survival. The air is thick with smoke, a testament to the tireless efforts undertaken within these industrial grounds. WestWard thrives as a vital cog in the machinery of Novemgrod's resilience.

GreenSide, a verdant suburb, stands as a testament to the city's agricultural prowess. Here, fertile fields stretch out as far as the eye can see, yielding abundant crops that sustain the populace and nourish trade. The district serves as a bustling hub for shipping and receiving, with a particular focus on the agricultural sector. Amidst the bountiful harvests, GreenSide boasts the largest skydock in Novemgrod, facilitating the efficient transportation of goods via airships that dot the sky.

Thus, within the enigmatic tapestry of Novemgrod's districts, a microcosm of contrasting worlds emerges. From the haunting recesses of the Hollowed Quarter to the stoic grandeur of the Palace District, from the clamor of industry in WestWard to the vibrant abundance of GreenSide, Novemgrod's diverse districts reflect the resilience and adaptability of its inhabitants in the face of adversity. Each district contributes its own unique flavor to the city's tapestry, weaving together the story of a once-great metropolis that continues to struggle for survival amidst the encroaching shadows.

## Exploring the Murk

In the treacherous realm of the Murk, explorers tread a path fraught with constant tension and an overwhelming sense of the unknown. The very essence of the Murk seems to possess an insidious intelligence, manipulating its density to confound and disorient those who dare to venture into its domain. The air they breathe is tainted, carrying a spectral miasma that permeates their senses and gnaws at their sanity. It is a place where reality warps and twists, shrouded in an enigmatic haze that defies comprehension.

The beings rumored to inhabit the Murk are whispered about in hushed tones, their true nature shrouded in mystery. Some say they are spectral apparitions, fleeting shadows that dance at the periphery of vision before vanishing into the depths. Others claim they are monstrous entities, born from the darkest recesses of nightmares, lurking within the murky abyss. Yet, despite the tales and whispers, encounters with these entities remain elusive, leaving explorers to question the veracity of their own perceptions and the true nature of the Murk's inhabitants.

Navigating the ever-changing tide of the Murk requires not only courage but also a keen sense of timing and intuition. Its fluctuations, like the rhythmic ebb and flow of an otherworldly ocean, create an atmosphere of constant suspense. One moment, the Murk may recede, unveiling an ethereal landscape bathed in an eerie luminescence, only to surge forward in the next instant, threatening to engulf all in its tenebrous embrace. These unpredictable shifts of the Murk's boundaries transform the borderlands into a treacherous labyrinth, where one wrong step can plunge explorers into a perilous chasm of uncertainty.

As explorers delve deeper into the Murk, a sense of unease settles in their hearts. It is not just the physical dangers that haunt their every step, but the psychological toll as well. The Murk has a way of whispering to their souls, seducing them with tantalizing secrets or luring them towards unseen perils. Its insidious influence slowly gnaws at their resolve, testing their sanity and resolve as they navigate the unfathomable depths. Only the strongest-willed and most resolute dare to persist in their quest, driven by an insatiable curiosity or a desperate need to unravel the mysteries hidden within the Murk's veiled embrace.

In the ever-shifting expanse of the Murk, where reality intertwines with the unknown, brave souls forge their path, driven by an unyielding determination to discover the truth. They are the Divers, fearless explorers who risk life and sanity in their pursuit of knowledge and revelation. Their tales are whispered in hushed tones, passed down through generations, weaving a tapestry of awe and dread. For within the Murk lies not only darkness and danger, but also the potential for untold discoveries and profound revelations

##### Wrath

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a state of wrath as a bonus action.

While in wrath, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using or a ranged attack from less than 30 ft, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a brute, as shown in the Wrath Damage column of the Brute table.

- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while in wrath.

Your wrath lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if yourturn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your wrath on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have been in wrath the number of times shown for your brute level in the Wrath column of the Brute table, you must finish a long rest before you can wrath again.

##### Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 8 + Proficiency + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

 
##### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls or ranged attack rolls within 30ft during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

##### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away fromdanger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

##### Wrathful Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your wrath. Choose the Path of the Reaver or the Path of Living Steel, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

##### Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.

##### Feral Instinct

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your wrath before doing anything else on that turn.
 
##### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

##### Relentless Wrath

Starting at 11th level, your wrath can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re in wrath and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

##### Persistent Wrath

Beginning at 15th level, your wrath is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

##### Indomitable Might

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

##### Ruinous Champion

At 20th level, you embody the power of the ruins.

Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4.

Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

#### Path of the Reaver

For some brutes, wrath is a means to an end— that end being violence. The Path of the Reaver is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the reaver’s wrath, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-­‐‑being.

##### Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you enter wrath. If you do so, for the duration of your wrath you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. At the end of the round you must make a DC 15 wisdom save or suffer 1d6 strain damage.
 
##### Mindless Wrath

Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while in wrath. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your wrath, the effect is suspended for the duration of the wrath.

##### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your bonus action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your nextturn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

##### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

#### Path of Living Steel

Your brutal existence culimated in the inclusion of mechanical and alchemical technology into your body.  The once dormant systems that gave you your potent anger now reactivate and begin to take hold.  What will you become?  A killing machine?  Or a will you retain what makes you human?

##### Machine Soul

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your wrathful nature becomes mechanical.  While Wrathful, you gain resistance to necrotic damage, immunity to sleep, and no longer need to breathe.  Whenever you are dealt lightning damage, you must make a DC 15 Consitution save or add an additional 1d8 to the damage taken.

##### One with Metal

Starting at 6th level, the Brute can wear heavy armor and is no longer restricted in using wrath while in heavy armor.  In addition, when they don armor, they can choose to make this armor part of their body. Doing so provides them the associated armor mastery feet and allows them to rest while in armor.

##### Living Weapon

Starting at 10th level, the Brute can fuse weapons to their body when entering wrath.  The weapons cannot be disarmed in any way, and ranged weapons lose their loading property for the duration of wrath.

##### New Skin

Starting at 10th level the Brute ignores maximum dexterity bonuses when applied to fused armor.

##### Cybernetic Organism

Starting at 14th level, your body loses all organic traces while in wrath.  When you reach 0 hp during wrath, you may roll a DC 8+Damage Done Constitution Check.  If successful you regain 1d12 HP and may continue the scene.

#### Expertise

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.

#### Sneak Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d10 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. 

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Knave table.

#### Thieves’ Cant

During your knave training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

#### Cunning Action

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You cantake a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

#### Roguish Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your knave abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Uncanny Dodge

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.

#### Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you tomake a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

#### Reliable Talent

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

#### Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

#### Slippery Mind

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

#### Elusive

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.

#### Stroke of Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Roguish Archetypes

Knaves have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different knaves steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the knave archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

#### Thief

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do knaves who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.

##### Fast Hands

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

##### Second-Story Work

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

##### Supreme Sneak

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

##### Use Magic Device

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.

##### Thief’s Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.

#### Charlatan

##### Deceptive Charm
Starting at 3rd level, you gain expertise in Deception and Persuasion skills if you don't already have them. Additionally, you can use your Sneak Attack feature against a creature that you have successfully deceived or persuaded during the current encounter, provided that creature is within 5 feet of you and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

##### Misdirection
Also at 3rd level, you can use your cunning to create distractions and mislead others. As a bonus action, you can choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Knave spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is distracted, granting advantage to your allies' attack rolls against it until the start of your next turn.

##### Silver Tongue
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Deception) checks made during social interactions. Additionally, when you make a Charisma check you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to the check if you are not already proficient.

##### Social Ambusher
At 13th level, you excel at ambushing foes during social engagements. When you roll initiative and are not surprised, you can choose to take a bonus action to Hide if you are in a situation where stealth is possible (such as a crowded room, dim light, or similar conditions). If you succeed on the Hide check, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against a creature that hasn't acted yet in the combat, as long as the attack is made within the next minute, if this attack hits, it is an automatic critical hit.

##### Master of Deception
Starting at 17th level, your mastery of deception knows no bounds. You can use your action to adopt a new persona for 1 hour, during which time you gain advantage on all Charisma checks made to deceive, persuade, or intimidate creatures that you interact with while in this persona. Additionally, once during this duration, you can automatically succeed on a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check against a creature that isn't hostile toward you.

This archetype focuses on using social skills to gain advantages in combat and deception, making the Charlatan Knave a master manipulator in both social and combat situations.

#### Esoteria

Trained for years in Magister's Tower of a great city, you've learned the secrets of the black circle and thus may cast spells using Esoteria.  
  - **Capabilities:**
    - **Reach Beyond:** Cast spells at higher levels by succeeding a Knowledge (Arcana) check (DC 15 + twice the spell level).
      - Success: Spell cast at intended level, inflicting 1 strain damage per spell point used.
      - Failure:
        - Option 1: Spell fails, causing strain damage.
        - Option 2: Spell succeeds at cost of personal life force, taking 1d4 HP damage per spell point used.
    - **Delve Deep:** Cast spells without sufficient spell points by making an Arcana check (DC 15 + double the spell level).
      - Success: Spell cast as intended, with strain damage incurred.
      - Failure:
        - Option 1: Spell fails, causing strain damage.
        - Option 2: Spell succeeds at cost of personal life force, taking 1d4 HP damage per spell point used.

As a student of arcane magic, you have a codex containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

##### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the magister spell list. You learn additional magister cantrips of your choice at higher levels.

##### Codex

At 1st level, you have a codex containing six 1st-level magister spells of your choice. Your codex is the repository of the magister spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Magister table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend points of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of magister spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of magister spells from your codex equal to your Intelligence modifier + your magister level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell points.

For example, if you’re a 3rd-level magister, you have 14 spell points. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your codex. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level point total. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of magister spells requires time spent studying your codex and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your magister spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a magister spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- **Spell save DC:** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
- **Spell attack modifier:** your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast a magister spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your codex. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.

##### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your magister spells.

##### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain a magister level, you can add two magister spells of your choice to your codex for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell points, as shown on the Magister table.

##### Esoteric Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your codex. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell points to recover. The spell points are equal to your Magister Level plus your Intelligence Modifier.


##### Esoteric Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##### Esoteric Knowledge

When you reach 3rd level, and every odd level to 17th, you may select 1 additional spell from any spell list that is 1 level lower than your maximum spell level.  These spells count as Magister spells for the purpose of your casting them.

##### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

##### Spell Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level magister spell and a 2nd-level magister spell that are in your codex. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell points when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell points as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

##### Signature Spells

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level magister spells in your codex as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending spell points. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend spell points as normal.


### Esoteric Traditions

The study of magistery is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.
The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Magisters through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even magisters who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.

#### Magister Subclass: Daemonologist

As a Daemonologist, you specialize in conjuring daemons, creatures of pure thought that you manifest into physical forms to serve your bidding. By delving into the depths of forbidden knowledge, you have gained mastery over these otherworldly entities, bending them to your will.

#### Daemon Conjure

Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to summon daemons to aid you in your endeavors. As an action, you can expend a spell points to summon a daemon of your choice from the Daemon Summoning list below. The summoned daemon appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you and obeys your verbal commands. The daemon remains for 1 hour, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Daemon Summoning List

Choose one daemon from the list below when you summon a daemon using your Daemon Conjure feature:

1. **Shadow Stalker:** A stealthy and agile daemon that excels in reconnaissance and sabotage.
2. **Flame Fiend:** A fiery daemon wreathed in flames, capable of burning foes with its scorching attacks.
3. **Frost Wraith:** An icy daemon that freezes the air around it, chilling enemies to the bone with its frosty touch.
4. **Spectral Specter:** A ghostly daemon that can phase through walls and strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.
5. **Venomous Viper:** A serpent-like daemon with poisonous fangs that can paralyze foes with its toxic bite.
6. **Thunder Titan:** A towering daemon wreathed in crackling electricity, capable of unleashing devastating lightning strikes.

#### Enhanced Daemon

Starting at 6th level, the daemons you summon through your Daemon Conjure feature gain additional abilities. Choose one of the following enhancements for your summoned daemon:

1. **Empowered Attacks:** The daemon's attacks deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.
2. **Resilient Form:** The daemon gains temporary hit points equal to your magister level at the start of each of its turns.
3. **Unseen Passage:** The daemon gains the ability to turn invisible at will, remaining unseen until it attacks or takes damage.

#### Master of Daemons

At 10th level, your mastery over daemons reaches new heights. You can now summon two daemons simultaneously when you use your Daemon Conjure feature. Additionally, the duration of your summoned daemons is extended to 8 hours, and they can understand any language you speak.

#### Daemon Overlord

Upon reaching 14th level, you ascend to the pinnacle of daemonology, becoming a true Daemon Overlord. Your summoned daemons gain the following benefits:

- They have advantage on all saving throws.
- Their attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks.
- Once per turn, when a daemon deals damage to a creature, it can cause that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of the daemon until the end of its next turn.

### Magister Subclass: Ritualist

As a Ritualist, you specialize in the art of performing intricate rituals to enhance your magical abilities and unlock the full potential of your spells. Through diligent study and disciplined practice, you have gained insight into the arcane rituals that shape the fabric of reality.

#### Ritual Mastery

Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't already have it. Additionally, you learn two 1st-level magister spells of your choice that have the ritual tag, which don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

#### Ritual Casting

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast spells as rituals. You can cast any magister spell you have prepared as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

#### Enhanced Spells

Starting at 6th level, you learn to perform rituals that enhance the power of your existing spells. When you cast a magister spell of 1st level or higher as a ritual, you can choose one of the following enhancements:

1. **Empowered Casting:** The spell's damage is increased by your Intelligence modifier.
2. **Extended Duration:** The spell's duration is doubled.
3. **Area of Effect:** The spell's area of effect is increased by 50%.

#### Master Ritualist

At 10th level, your mastery of rituals allows you to perform them with greater efficiency. You can now cast any magister spell you have prepared as a ritual without expending spell points. Additionally, you can cast rituals in half the usual time, and you can perform rituals even if you are unable to speak or gesture.

#### Arcane Augmentation

Upon reaching 14th level, you unlock the ability to infuse your spells with potent arcane energy. When you cast a magister spell of 1st level or higher as a ritual, you can expend additional spell points to further augment its effects. For each spell point you expend in this way, the spell gains one of the enhancements listed in the Enhanced Spells feature.

#### Master of Arcane Rites

At 18th level, you become a true master of arcane rites. You gain the following benefits:

- You can cast any magister spell you have prepared as a ritual without expending a spell points, regardless of whether it has the ritual tag.
- When you cast a spell as a ritual, you can choose two enhancements from the Enhanced Spells feature instead of one.
- The duration of spells cast as rituals is further doubled, and their area of effect is increased by an additional 50%.

### Magister Subclass: Battlemage

As a Battlemage, you blend martial prowess with arcane mastery, specializing in the art of battle magic to defend allies and unleash devastating spells upon your enemies. Whether on the front lines or commanding from the rear, you are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.

#### Arcane Combatant

Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor, simple weapons, and one martial weapon of your choice. Additionally, when you cast a magister cantrip that deals damage, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

#### Arcane Ward

At 2nd level, you learn to create a protective shield of magical energy that absorbs damage. As a reaction when you take damage, you can expend spell points to create a magical ward that reduces the damage taken. The ward absorbs a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the expended spell points plus your Intelligence modifier.

#### Arcane Strike

Starting at 6th level, you can infuse your weapon attacks with arcane energy, allowing you to deal additional damage. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend spell points to deal extra force damage equal to the level of the expended spell points plus your Intelligence modifier.

#### Arcane Bulwark

At 10th level, your mastery of defensive magic reaches new heights. You gain resistance to force damage, and you can use your Arcane Ward feature as a bonus action on your turn. Additionally, when you create your Arcane Ward, you can choose to have it absorb all damage from a single attack instead of reducing the damage taken.

#### Master of Destruction

Upon reaching 14th level, you become a master of unleashing destructive magic upon your foes. Whenever you cast a magister spell that deals damage, you can choose to maximize the damage dealt, instead of rolling for damage. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Avatar of Arcana

At 18th level, you transcend the boundaries between magic and martial prowess, becoming an embodiment of arcane power on the battlefield. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- You can use your Arcane Ward feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) without expending spell points.
- Whenever you deal damage with a magister spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.
- When you roll initiative and have no remaining uses of your Arcane Ward, you regain one use.

#### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or other within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or other) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.


#### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your oathbound level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on other and constructs.

#### Oathbound Weapon
Your devotion is so powerful that your weapon is bathed in energy. Each  attack you perform adds the listed dice as damage. The damage type is the same as the base attack, but Oaths adjust them at level 3. 

#### Auras
At 1st level, your mere presence is enough to inspire allies and protect them with your holy power. There are two kinds of auras a oathbound can know, major and minor. You begin play knowing 1 of each. When you gain certain oathbound levels, you gain additional auras of your choice, as shown in the major aura and minor aura columns of the oathbound table.

You may only have 1 aura, of either type, active. You may use your bonus action to activate or switch your aura. The aura affects you and all allies within 10 feet of you, at 11th level this distance increases to 30ft. and at 17th level it increases to 60ft. Your aura bonus is equal to you Charisma modifier.

#### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.  You gain an additional fighting style at level 9.

Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield

Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Divine Health
By 2nd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

#### Sacred Oath
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a oathbound forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. The Oaths are detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include the Channel Divinity feature and other features.

#### Channel Divinity
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your oathbound spell save DC.

Beginning at 13th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests.

##### Channel Divinity: Turn the Other
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and other, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or other that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

#### Sacred Oaths
Choose from Oath of Compassion, Oath of Zealous Action, Oath of Radiance

#### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Bastion of Faith
Starting at 6th level, you may now have both a major aura and a minor aura active at the same time.

#### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Divine Intervention

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any priest spell or priest religion spell would be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

You deal 1d6 bonus in damage when dealing damage to them with weapons.  This damage increases to 1d8 at 6th level and 2d6 at 14th level.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.
You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

#### Natural Explorer

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or murk. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:

•	Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
•	Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
•	Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
•	If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
•	When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
•	While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

#### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
 
Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-­‐‑weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Second Wind
At 2nd level You have a limited well of stamina you can draw upon to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your ranger level. Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
 
#### Primeval Awareness
Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you. You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack. You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.


#### Pathfinder Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate, such as the Hunter. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.


#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Wilderness Medicine
In their favored terrain, the ranger is adept at utilizing local flora and fauna with healing properties. Dungeon Stalkers are similarly familiar with various subterranean mosses, lichens, spider silk, etc. Medicine checks in favored terrain are made using the ranger’s proficiency bonus. Once per day, given an hour of preparation time, you can craft potions or poultices (1d4 uses) that will heal hit points equal to 1d8+ the ranger’s level. In addition, these items will halt (cure) the progression of any non-magical disease contracted the same day. In a similar fashion, the ranger can craft an antitoxin to counter the effects of poison (1 use per hour spent). All items crafted by the ranger in this manner are perishable and need to be used within one day of being created, or they will spoil and be useless. Use of this feature requires an herbalism kit.

#### Fleet of Foot
Beginning at 7th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

#### Land’s Stride

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.

#### Environmental Resilience
At 9th level in their favored terrain, the ranger makes all Constitution checks with advantage. The ranger gains the following damage resistance based on their favored terrain, but it applies at all times:

Arctic Cold
Coast Cold
Desert Fire
Forest Cold
Grassland Cold
Mountain Cold
Swamp Poison
Underdark Poison

The damage resistance granted by this feature can only be taken once, using the ranger’s original choice of favored terrain. Additional favored terrains do not grant additional damage resistances.

#### Hide in Plain Sight

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

 
Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

#### Stalker’s Flurry
Starting at 13th level, once on each of your turns when you miss with an attack, you can make another attack.

#### Vanish

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

Improved Wilderness Medicine
You gain proficiency in Medicine. When using the Wilderness Medicine feature, the ranger’s potions or poultices restore hits points equal to 2d8 + the ranger’s level. In addition to being a preventative against disease, the potions or poultices will also halt the advancement of lycanthropy provided the bite is less than a day old. You can craft two doses of antitoxin per hour spent. Items crafted with this feature will maintain their potency without spoiling for 1d4 days. Use of this feature requires an herbalism kit.

#### Stalker’s Dodge
At 17th level, whenever a creature attacks you and does not have advantage, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the creature’s attack roll against you. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.

#### Feral Senses

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.

#### Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

### Pathfinder Archetypes

#### Bounty Hunter

##### Marked Prey
At 3rd level, you learn to mark your prey for swift and precise pursuit. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to mark them as your prey.

You can’t be surprised by your marked prey, and they can’t escape your notice unless they successfully hide from you.
Your marked prey can’t benefit from invisibility or being heavily obscured to hide from you.
You have advantage on all attack rolls against your marked prey.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Shadow

##### Sharpshooter's Focus
You may spend your bonus action to aim your ranged weapon, gaining advantage on your next ranged attack roll.  This ability can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.  This ability recharges on a short rest.

##### Ambush Hunter
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to strike with deadly precision from the shadows. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack from hiding or while unseen by your target, you deal 2d6 extra damage. This extra damage increases to 3d8 at 11th level and 4d10 at 17th level.

##### Camouflage Expertise
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to camouflage yourself in natural surroundings. While camouflaged, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide and Wisdom (Perception) checks made to spot creatures. You can remain camouflaged in this way for up to 1 hour, or until you move or take an action other than maintaining your camouflage.

##### Sniper's Precision
At 11th level, you gain the ability to target weak spots with incredible accuracy. When you make a weapon attack with a longbow or sniper rifle against a creature, you can choose to make a called shot. If the attack hits, you deal extra damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus plus Wisdom modifier, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your Ranger spell save DC or suffer disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

##### Vanishing Act
Starting at 15th level, you can disappear from sight in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest spell list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.
 
##### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Priest table shows how many spell points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend points of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest spell list. When you do so, choose a number of priest spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your priest level (minimum of one spell). The spells must beof a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-­‐‑level priest, 14 spell points. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-­‐‑level spell cure wounds, you can cast it as a 1st-- - level or 2nd-- - level spell. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your priest spells. The power of your spells comes fromyour devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a priest spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
- Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast a priest spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

##### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your priest spells.

#### Faith and Religion

Choose one diety, such as The Penitent Choir. Each faith is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you religion spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Faith when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

##### Religious Spells

Each religion has a list of spells—its religion spells— that you gain at the priest levels noted in the religion description. Once you gain a religion spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a religion spell that doesn’t appear on the priest spell list, the spell is nonetheless a priest spell for you.

##### Channel Faith

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Other and an effect determined by your religion. Some religions grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the religion description.

When you use your Channel Faith, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Faith again.

Some Channel Faith effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Faith twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

###### Channel Faith: Turn Other

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the outsiders. Each outsider that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
 
 
#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Destroy Other

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Other feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Other table.

| Priest Level | Destroys Other of CR . . . |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| 5th          | 1/2 or lower              |
| 8th          | 1 or lower                |
| 11th         | 2 or lower                |
| 14th         | 3 or lower                |
| 17th         | 4 or lower                |




#### Divine Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your priest level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any priest spell or priest religion spell would be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

### Religions of Tellus

#### The Charred One:
This deity represents death, fire, hatred, fear, and pain. Their followers seek the destruction and unmaking of all creation, employing manipulation, intrigue, and acts of destruction to fulfill their goals. They find solace in the burned-out cities and ruins, spreading their mad god's will.

##### Charred one Spell List
| Priest Level | Spells                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| 1st          | Burning Hands, Hellish Rebuke        |
| 3rd          | Flaming Sphere, Scorching Ray |
| 5th          | Fireball, Conjure Lesser Demon  |
| 7th          | Wall of Fire, Summon Greater Demon|
| 9th          | Flame Strike, Immolation |

##### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this religion at 1st level, you gain the Firebolt cantrip if you don't already know it. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know.

##### Channel Divinity: Touch of Destruction
Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature or object with flame. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use Channel Divinity to deal extra fire damage to the target. The damage equals 10 + twice your cleric level.

##### Inescapable Destruction
Starting at 6th level, your ability to channel destructive energy becomes more potent. Fire damage dealt by your cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to fire damage.

##### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with fire energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an a 1d12 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d12.

##### Destructive Form

Starting at 17th level, you may use Channel Divinity to deal your Touch of Destruction to everyone within 30 feet.  The save for this is equal to your spell save for priest.


#### The High Nine:
 Focused on fate, power, cold, life, and death, the High Nine emphasize embracing the currents of life and the wisdom offered by their gods. Listeners, their followers, reach beyond the present moment to connect with ancient chants and words, becoming vessels of fate.

 ##### The High Nine Spell List

Once you use this feature to learn something about a creature, you can't use it on that creature again until you complete a short or long rest.

# Beyond 1st Level

As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.

## Character Advancement

| Experience Points | Level | Proficiency Bonus |

## Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in magister and two in soldier, you’re a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a brute who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

#### Multiclassing Prerequisites

| Class     | Ability Score Minimum |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Brute | Strength 13           |
| Priest    | Wisdom 13             |
| Druid     | Wisdom 13             |
| Soldier   | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |
| Monk      | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Oathbound   | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
| Pathfiner    | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Knave     | Dexterity 13          |
| Sorcerer  | Charisma 13           |
| Magister    | Intelligence 13       |

## Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a priest 6/soldier 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a soldier or your seventh level as a priest.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the soldier and the oathbound have a d10, so if you are a oathbound 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a oathbound 5/priest 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a soldier 3/knave 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

#### Multiclassing Proficiencies

| Class      | Proficiencies Gained                                            |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute  | Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                        |
| Priest     | Light armor, medium armor, shields                               |
| Druid      | Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) |
| Soldier    | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Monk       | Simple weapons, shortswords                                      |
| Oathbound    | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Pathfiner     | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list |
| Knave      | Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools |
| Sorcerer   | —                                                               |
| Magister     | —                                                               |

### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

#### Channel Divinity

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a priest 6/oathbound 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the priest class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

#### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the soldier’s version of Extra Attack does). 

#### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.

### Spellcasting

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

#### Spells Known and Prepared

You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a pathfiner 4/magister 3, for example, you know three 1st-level pathfiner spells based on your levels in the pathfiner class. As a 3rd-level magister, you know three magister cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten magister spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a magister) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six magister spells from your spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

#### SpellPoints
Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.

This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.

#### Spell Point Cost
| Spell Level | Point Cost |
|-------------|------------|
| 1st         | 2          |
| 2nd         | 3          |

## Alignment

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

- **Lawful Good (LG):** Creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, oathbounds, and most dwarves are lawful good.

- **Neutral Good (NG):** Folks do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.

- **Chaotic Good (CG):** Creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.

- **Lawful Neutral (LN):** Individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some magisters are lawful neutral.

- **Neutral (N):** The alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.

- **Chaotic Neutral (CN):** Creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many brutes and knaves are chaotic neutral.

- **Lawful Evil (LE):** Creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.

- **Neutral Evil (NE):** The alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.

- **Chaotic Evil (CE):** Creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.

### Alignment in the Multiverse

For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.

The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

## Languages

Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.

### Standard Languages

| Language   | Typical Speakers    | Script   |
|------------|----------------------|----------|
| Common     | Humans               | Common   |
| Dwarvish   | Dwarves              | Dwarvish |
| Elvish     | Elves                | Elvish   |
| Giant      | Ogres, giants        | Dwarvish |
| Gnomish    | Gnomes               | Dwarvish |
| Goblin     | Goblinoids           | Dwarvish |
| Halfling   | Halflings            | Common   |
| Orc        | Orcs                 | Dwarvish |

### Exotic Languages

| Language    | Typical Speakers      | Script   |
|-------------|------------------------|----------|
| Abyssal     | Demons                 | Infernal |
| Celestial   | Celestials             | Celestial |
| Draconic    | Dragons, dragonborn    | Draconic |
| Deep Speech | Aboleths, cloakers     | —        |
| Infernal    | Devils                 | Infernal |
| Primordial  | Elementals             | Dwarvish |
| Sylvan      | Fey creatures          | Elvish   |
| Undercommon | Underworld traders     | Elvish   |

## Inspiration

Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.

### Gaining Inspiration

Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

## Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your soldier might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your magister could have been a sage or an artisan. Your knave might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample background presented here provides both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

### Proficiencies

Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”). In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”). If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

### Languages

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”

### Equipment

Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

### Suggested Characteristics

A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

### Customizing a Background

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

# Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise. You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

### Abundant Familiars
When you summon a familiar, you may summon an additional one. (Flock of Familiars would now summon 6 familiars)

### Craven
Your Sneak Attack deals 2d10 additional damage.

### Cruel
You have a number of cruelty points equal to your proficiency modifier. Once per turn, whenever you deal damage to a creature with an attack you can spend one cruelty point to deal an additional 1d10 damage of the attack damage type to that creature. You can also spend one cruelty point when you score a critical hit against a creature to regain 1d10 hit points. While making Charisma (Intimidation) checks that involve inflicting pain, you can spend one cruelty point to gain advantage on the roll. You regain your expended cruelty points when you finish a long rest, and you regain one

### Daring Outlaw

Requirement: Knave Level 3

If you have the Sneak Attack class feature, your Ranger levels now count toward Rogue levels for Sneak Attack dice progression.

### Dimensional Savant
When you attack a creature after you teleport via a spell or class ability, it is considered threatened for the purposes of sneak attack and it is considered flanked.

### Dissolver
When you damage a creature with a spell that deals acid damage you also lower that creature's AC by 1 until the start of your next turn.

### Divine Might
Once per turn prior to taking the attack action you can spend a use of channel divinity to instead add your Charisma bonus to your weapon damage until the end of turn.

### Divine Vigor

You gain an additional reaction.

### Explosive
Your Fire damage spells deal 1 Fire spell damage for each damage dice to each creature within spells effect and within 5ft of the spells effect. (If the spell has a single target effect then it hits each creature around the target. This can damage you. This can also damage a creature with evasion because this effect does not require a saving throw.)

### Expose Weakness
When you Sneak Attack a creature with a melee weapon attack that creature is considered flanked regardless of its positioning until the start of your next turn. (All creatures that attack it benefit from flanking, including ranged and spell attacks.)

### Extra Lay on Hands
You count as 3 levels higher for your Lay on Hands healing pool.

### Fast Drinker
You can drink one potion or other similar substance per round as an object interaction. Additionally you gain +1 stat of your choice.

### Fiery Reflex

# Equipment

Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

**Standard Exchange Rates**

| Coin      | CP   | SP   | EP   | GP    | PP     |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| Copper    | 1    | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/1,000|
| Silver    | 10   | 1    | 1/5  | 1/10  | 1/100  |
| Electrum  | 50   | 5    | 1    | 1/2   | 1/20   |
| Gold      | 100  | 10   | 2    | 1     | 1/10   |
| Platinum  | 1,000| 100  | 20   | 10    | 1      |

# Selling Treasure

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment**

As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

**Magic Items**

Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.

**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects**

These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

**Trade Goods**

On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

# Armor

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.

**Armor Proficiency**

Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

**Armor Class (AC)**

Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**Heavy Armor**

Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth**

If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields**

A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

**Umbralite Energy Shield**

The Umbralite Energy Shield is a remarkable technological marvel infused with magical energies. It manifests as a shimmering barrier of dark energy that envelops the wearer, providing temporary protection against incoming attacks. 
Functionality: When activated, the Umbralite Energy Shield generates a protective barrier around the wearer, granting temporary hit points that absorb damage before affecting the wearer's actual health. The shield replenishes these temporary hit points at the start of each round, providing ongoing defense during combat situations.

*Stats and Features:*

- Activation: Bonus Action
- Duration: 1 minute (10 rounds)
- Temporary Hit Points: 5 + Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) at the start of each of the wearer's turns
- Weight: 5 lbs.
- Requires Attunement: Yes

Additional Properties:

- Absorption Field: The shield has a limited capacity to absorb energy-based attacks. It grants resistance to one type of energy damage (fire, cold, acid, lightning, etc.) for the duration of the shield's activation. This resistance can be changed each time the shield is activated.
- Adaptive Defense: The Umbralite Energy Shield adapts to the wearer's combat style. While active, it grants advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that would restrict movement, such as grapples or restraining spells.
- Overload Release: In dire situations, the wearer can release an overload of energy from the shield, causing a burst of dark energy in a 10-foot radius around them. This burst deals necrotic damage equal to the wearer's Constitution modifier to all creatures in the area. After using this feature, the shield deactivates and cannot be used again until the wearer completes a long rest.

Each activaion of the shield requires the expenditure of an Umbralite Crystal.

**Light Armor**

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

- **Padded:** Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.
- **Tanned Leather:** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.
- **Studded Hide:** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.

**Medium Armor**

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

- **Beastmaster's Hide:** This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.
- **Chain Vest:** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.
- **Scale Mail:** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
- **Umbralite Breastplate:** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.
- **Half Plate:** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.

**Heavy Armor**

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

- **Umbralite Rings:** This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor.
- **Chain Hauberk:** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.
- **Splint Armor:** This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.
- **Umbralite Plate:** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

## Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.

- **Don:** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.
- **Doff:** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

**Donning and Doffing Armor**

| Category      | Don         | Doff       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Light Armor   | 1 minute    | 1 minute   |
| Medium Armor  | 5 minutes   | 1 minute   |
| Heavy Armor   | 10 minutes  | 5 minutes  |
| Shield        | 1 action    | 1 action   |

# Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

**Weapon Proficiency**

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

**Weapon Properties**

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

- **Ammunition:** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
- **Finesse:** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- **Heavy:** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.
- **Light:** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
- **Loading:** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
- **Range:** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.
- **Reach:** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
- **Special:** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description.
- **Thrown:** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
- **Two-Handed:** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
- **Versatile:** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Improvised Weapons**

Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.
Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d8 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d8 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

**Silvered Weapons**

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

**Special Weapons**

Weapons with special rules are described here.

- **Lance:** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.
- **Net:** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

## Adventuring Gear

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

| Item                | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| **Acid**            | As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. |
| **Alchemist’s Fire** | This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. |
| **Antitoxin**       | A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs. |
| **Arcane Focus**    | An arcane focus is a special item— an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item— designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or magister can use such an item as a spellcasting focus. |
| **Ball Bearings**   | As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. |
| **Block and Tackle** | A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift. |
| **Book**            | A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section). |
| **Caltrops**        | As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. |
| **Candle**          | For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. |
| **Case, Crossbow Bolt** | This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts. |
| **Case, Map or Scroll** | This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment. |
| **Chain**           | A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check. |
| **Climber’s Kit**   | A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor. |
| **Component Pouch** | A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description). |
| **Crowbar**         | Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied. |
| **Druidic Focus**   | A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus. |
| **Fishing Tackle**  | This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. |
| **Healer’s Kit**    | This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. |
| **Holy Symbol**     | A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield. |
| **Holy Water**      | As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot. |
| **Hunting Trap**    | When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature. |
| **Lamp**              | A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. |
| **Lantern, Bullseye** | A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. |
| **Lantern, Hooded**   | A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius. |
| **Lock**              | A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices. |
| **Magnifying Glass**  | This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed. |
| **Manacles**          | These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points. |
| **Mess Kit**          | This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl. |
| **Oil**               | Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. |
| **Poison, Basic**     | You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. |
| **Potion of Healing** | A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action. |
| **Pouch**             | A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). |
| **Quiver**            | A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. |
| **Ram, Portable**     | You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check. |
| **Rations**           | Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. |
| **Rope**              | Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check. |
| **Scale, Merchant’s** | A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth. |
| **Spellbook**         | Essential for magisters, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells. |
| **Spyglass**          | Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. |
| **Tent**              | A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two. |
| **Tinderbox**         | This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute. |
| **Torch**             | A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage. |

### Equipment Packs

The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here.

### Tools

A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft.

Each type of artisan’s tools requires a separate proficiency.

### Mounts and Vehicles

A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and base carrying capacity. An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.

Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.

**Barding**: Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.

**Saddles**: A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.

**Vehicle Proficiency**: If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.

### Expenses

When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

**Lifestyle Expenses**

| Lifestyle    | Cost per Day | Acquire DC |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Wretched     | —            | —          |
| Squalid      | 1 sp         | 8          |
| Poor         | 2 sp         | 10         |
| Modest       | 1 gp         | 12         |
| Comfortable  | 2 gp         | 15         |
| Wealthy      | 4 gp         | 18         |
| Aristocratic | 10 gp        | 20         |


At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

### Lifestyle Expenses

| Lifestyle    | Price/Day |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Wretched     | —         |
| Squalid      | 1 sp      |
| Poor         | 2 sp      |
| Modest       | 1 gp      |
| Comfortable  | 2 gp      |
| Wealthy      | 4 gp      |
| Aristocratic | 10 gp min |

**Wretched**: You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.

**Squalid**: You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.

**Poor**: A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

**Modest**: A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge magisters, and the like.

**Comfortable**: Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

**Wealthy**: Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

**Aristocratic**: You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

### Self-Sufficiency

The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.

Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

### Services

Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a magister might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.

### Services

| Service          | Pay                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Coach cab        |                        |
| Between towns    | 3 cp per mile          |
| Within a city    | 1 cp                   |
| Hireling         |                        |
| Skilled          | 2 gp per day           |
| Untrained        | 2 sp per day           |
| Messenger        | 2 cp per mile          |
| Road or gate toll| 1 cp                   |
| Ship’s passage   | 1 sp per mile          |

**Skilled hirelings** include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. **Untrained hirelings** are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

### Spellcasting Services

People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.

Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.


# Spellcasting

Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.

This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.

### What Is a Spell?

A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix PH-A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.

Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.

### Spell Level

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.

### Known and Prepared Spells

Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and magisters, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.

In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.

### Spell Points
Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.

This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.

Spell Point Cost
| Spell Level | Point Cost |

| 1st         | 2          |
| 2nd         | 3          |

| 20th        | 133          | 9th             |

### Casting in Armor

Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.

### Cantrips

A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.

### Rituals

Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.

To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the magister’s does.

### Casting a Spell

When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

### Casting Time

Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

#### Bonus Action

A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

#### Reactions

Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.

#### Longer Casting Times

Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.

### Range

The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect”).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.

### Components

A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.

#### Verbal (V)

Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.

#### Somatic (S)

Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

#### Material (M)

Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.

If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.

### Duration

A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

#### Instantaneous

Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

#### Concentration

Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

- Casting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
- Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.
- Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.

#### Targets

A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

#### A Clear Path to the Target

To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.

### Areas of Effect

Spells such as *burning hands* and *cone of cold* cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object. A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

#### Cone

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cube

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cylinder

A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.

#### Line

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Sphere

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

### Saving Throws

Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

### Attack Rolls

Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.

### The Schools of Magic

Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly magisters, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.

The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.

- **Abjuration:** Spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.
  
- **Conjuration:** Spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
  
- **Divination:** Spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.
  
- **Enchantment:** Spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
  
- **Evocation:** Spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.
  
- **Illusion:** Spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
  
- **Necromancy:** Spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
  
- **Transmutation:** Spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.



#  Spell Descriptions

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder’s stomach)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 acid damage immediately and 2d8 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

###  Acid Splash

- Conjuration cantrip
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 acid damage.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

###  Aid

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)

###  Alarm

- 1st-level abjuration (ritual)
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

###  Alter Self

- 2nd-level transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

- Aquatic Adaptation
- Change Appearance
- Natural Weapons

**At Higher Levels:** You can use your action to change your appearance again during the spell's duration.

###  Animal Friendship

- 1st-level enchantment
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast per level above 1st.

###  Animal Messenger

- 2nd-level enchantment (ritual)
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

**At Higher Levels:** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

###  Animal Shapes

- 8th-level transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 24 hours

Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.

The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

###  Animate Dead

- 3rd-level necromancy
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

###  Animate Objects

- 5th-level transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

###  Animated Object Statistics

| Size   | HP | AC | Attack                          | Str | Dex |
|--------|----|----|---------------------------------|-----|-----|
| Tiny   | 20 | 18 | +8 to hit, 1d8 + 4 damage       | 4   | 18  |
| Small  | 25 | 16 | +6 to hit, 1d12 + 2 damage       | 6   | 14  |
| Medium | 40 | 13 | +5 to hit, 2d10 + 1 damage       | 10  | 12  |
| Large  | 50 | 10 | +6 to hit, 4d8 + 2 damage      | 14  | 10  |
| Huge   | 80 | 10 | +8 to hit, 4d10 + 4 damage      | 18  | 6   |

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.

If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

**At Higher Levels:** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

###  Antilife Shell

- 5th-level abjuration
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.
The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.

###  Antimagic Field

- 8th-level abjuration
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

...

###  Arcane Sword

- 7th-level evocation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.
When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 6d8 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d12 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d10 for each slot level above 5th.

###  Arcanist’s Magic Aura

- 2nd-level illusion
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.

When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

- **False Aura:** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.
- **Mask:** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.

###  Astral Projection

- 9th-level necromancy
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Special

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.

Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.

The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.

The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.

If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.

###  Augury

- 2nd-level divination (ritual)
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:

- Weal, for good results
- Woe, for bad results
- Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
- Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad

The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.

###  Awaken

- 5th-level transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 8 hours
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.

The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

###  Bestow Curse

- 3rd-level necromancy
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

1. Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
2. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
3. While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
4. While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d12 necrotic damage to the target.

- **At Higher Levels:** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.

###  Blade Barrier

- 6th-level evocation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 12d8 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly above you. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 2d8.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

1. You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

2. Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; and three silver pins)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.

A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d12 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for each slot level above 6th.

**1st-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

**Necromancy cantrip**

- **Duration:** 1 round

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 necrotic damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.

If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

**This spell’s damage increases by 1d12** when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

###  Clairvoyance

**3rd-level divination**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.

When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.

---

###  Clone

**8th-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, a cubic inch of flesh of the creature to be cloned, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold a Medium creature, such as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.

At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original’s equipment. The original creature’s physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can’t thereafter be restored to life, since the creature’s soul is elsewhere.

---

###  Cloudkill

**5th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d12 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

###  Color Spray

**1st-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand in red, yellow, and blue)
- **Duration:** 1 round

A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 12d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can’t see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the spell ends. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

---

###  Command

**1st-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends.

- Approach: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.
- Drop: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
- Flee: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.
- Grovel: The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

**5th-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy/unholy water)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

---

###  Commune with Nature

**5th-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn’t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.

You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:

- terrain and bodies of water
- prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
- powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead
- influence from other planes of existence
- buildings

For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.

###  Comprehend Languages

**1st-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.

---

###  Compulsion

**4th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it can't be charmed. On a failed save, a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect.

A target isn't compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.

---

###  Cone of Cold

**5th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 5th.

---

###  Confusion

**4th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (three nut shells)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

**d10 Behavior**
1. The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d12 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.
2–6. The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.
7–8. The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.
9–10. The creature can act and move normally.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.

- One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower
- Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower
- Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower

Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.

- **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)

You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

The GM has the elemental’s statistics.

###  Contact Other Plane

**5th-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d10 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

---

###  Contagion

**5th-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 7 days

Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.

At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.

- **Blinding Sickness:** Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.
- **Filth Fever:** A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.
- **Flesh Rot:** The creature’s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.
- **Mindfire:** The creature’s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.
- **Seizure:** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.
- **Slimy Doom:** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

###  Contingency

**6th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)
- **Duration:** 10 days

Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells.

For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends. The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends.

Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

---

###  Continual Flame

**2nd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

---

###  Control Water

**4th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

1. **Flood:** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

2. **Part Water:** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

3. **Redirect Flow:** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

4. **Whirlpool:** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

---

###  Control Weather

**8th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d8 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

---

###  Counterspell

**3rd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.

---

###  Create Food and Water

**3rd-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S

- **Components:** V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.

### Creation

**5th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)
- **Duration:** Special

You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

- **Vegetable matter:** 1 day
- **Stone or crystal:** 12 hours
- **Precious metals:** 1 hour
- **Gems:** 10 minutes
- **Adamantine or mithral:** 1 minute

Using any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

---

### Cure Wounds

**1st-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

### Dancing Lights

**Evocation cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.

---

### Darkness

**2nd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

---

### Darkvision

**2nd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

---

### Daylight

**3rd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.

If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

---

### Death Ward

**4th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.

The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.

If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.

---

### Delayed Blast Fireball

**7th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell’s base damage is 12d10. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d10.
If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 7th.

---

### Demiplane

**8th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.

Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.

---

### Detect Evil and Good

**1st-level divination**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

---

### Detect Magic

**1st-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

---

### Detect Poison and Disease

**1st-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a yew leaf)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

### Detect Thoughts

**2nd-level divination**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a copper piece)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.

---

### Dimension Door

**4th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 500 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as “200 feet straight downward” or “upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.”

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.

If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d10 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.

---

### Disguise Self

**1st-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

---

### Disintegrate

**6th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d10 for each slot level above 6th.

---

### Dispel Evil and Good

**5th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.

**Break Enchantment.** As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

**Dismissal.** As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn’t there already). If they aren’t on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.

---

### Dispel Magic

**3rd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

---

### Divination

**4th-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god’s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.

---

### Divine Favor

**1st-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your prayer empowers you with divine radiance. Until the spell ends, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.

---

### Divine Word

**7th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:

- 50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
- 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes
- 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
- 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly

Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn’t there already) and can’t return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a wish spell.

---

### Dominate Beast

**4th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

---

### Dominate Person

**5th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.

### Dream

**5th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Special
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings but can’t take actions or move.

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.

You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d10 psychic damage.

If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.

---

### Druidcraft

**Transmutation cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

- You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
- You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
- You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

### Earthquake

**8th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 500 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.

- **Fissures:** Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d10 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 2d8 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse.

- **Structures:** The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d10 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.

---

### Eldritch Blast

**Evocation cantrip**

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

---

### Enhance Ability

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)

You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.

- **Bull’s Strength:** The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.
- **Cat’s Grace:** The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t incapacitated.
- **Eagle’s Splendor:** The target has advantage on Charisma checks.
- **Fox’s Cunning:** The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.
- **Owl’s Wisdom:** The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

### Enlarge/Reduce

**2nd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

- **Enlarge:** The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category— from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d8 extra damage.

- **Reduce:** The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d8 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).

### Entangle

**1st-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

---

### Enthrall

**2nd-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can’t be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak.

---

### Etherealness

**7th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Up to 8 hours

You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can’t see anything more than 60 feet away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive you and can’t interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.

When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.

---

### Expeditious Retreat

**1st-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

This spell allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this spell, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take the Dash action.

---

### Eyebite

**6th-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the spell’s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can’t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of eyebite.

- **Asleep:** The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.
- **Panicked:** The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.
- **Sickened:** The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.

### Fabricate

**4th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.

Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures or magic items can’t be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can’t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan’s tools used to craft such objects.

---

### Faerie Fire

**1st-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.

---

### Faithful Hound

**4th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.

The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can’t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound’s attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d12 piercing damage.

---

### False Life

**1st-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d8 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.

- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You project a phantasmal image of a creature’s worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.

While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

---

### Feather Fall

**1st-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a small feather or piece of down)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature’s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.

---

### Feeblemind

**8th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d10 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.

At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.

The spell can also be ended by greater restoration, heal, or wish.

---

### Find Familiar

**1st-level conjuration (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature. Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

---

### Find Steed

**2nd-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.

When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.

While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

### Find the Path

**6th-level divination**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools—such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes—worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn’t specific (such as “a green dragon’s lair”), the spell fails.

For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.

---

### Find Traps

**2nd-level divination**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

---

### Finger of Death

**7th-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d12 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.

---

### Fireball

**3rd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d12 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d12 cold damage from a cold shield.

---

### Fire Storm

**7th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 14d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this spell.

---

### Flame Blade

**2nd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (leaf of sumac)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 fire damage. The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

---

### Flame Strike

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 fire damage and 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

### Flaming Sphere

**2nd-level conjuration**

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere’s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

---

### Flesh to Stone

**6th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target’s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected.

A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.

---

### Floating Disk

**1st-level conjuration (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

---

### Fly

**3rd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.

---

### Forbiddance

**6th-level abjuration (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 day

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the plane shift spell.

In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 10d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).

When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.

The spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.

---

### Forcecage

**7th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.

---

### Foresight

**9th-level divination**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute

- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target’s movement or attacks.

---

### Freezing Sphere

**6th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d10 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

### Gaseous Form

**3rd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it’s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn’t affected.

While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast spells.

### Gate

**9th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

---

### Geas

**5th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 30 days

You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 10d8 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

---

### Gentle Repose

**2nd-level necromancy (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)
- **Duration:** 10 days

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.
The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.

---

### Giant Insect

**4th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.
The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.

---

### Glibness

**8th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.

---

### Globe of Invulnerability

**6th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.
Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

---

### Glyph of Warding

**3rd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

**Explosive Runes:** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d12 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Spell Glyph:** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.

### Goodberry

**1st-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.

---

### Grease

**1st-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.
When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

---

### Greater Invisibility

**4th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

### Greater Restoration

**5th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target’s exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on the target:
- One effect that charmed or petrified the target
- One curse, including the target’s attunement to a cursed magic item
- Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores
- One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum

---

### Guardian of Faith

**4th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 8 hours

A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.

Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.

---

### Guards and Wards

**6th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.

When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area:

- Corridors: Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
- Doors: All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
- Stairs: Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.
- Other Spell Effect: You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold:
  - Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.
  - Place magic mouth in two locations.
  - Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.
  - Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.
  - Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.

The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.

### Guidance

**Divination cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S

### Guiding Bolt

**1st-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

---

### Gust of Wind

**2nd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a legume seed)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.
The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

### Hallow

**5th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 24 hours
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.

1. Celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.

2. You can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.

   - Courage: Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area.
   - Darkness: Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can’t illuminate the area.
   - Daylight: Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can’t extinguish the light.
   - Energy Protection: Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
   - Energy Vulnerability: Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
   - Everlasting Rest: Dead bodies interred in the area can’t be turned into undead.
   - Extradimensional Interference: Affected creatures can’t move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.
   - Fear: Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.
   - Silence: No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.
   - Tongues: Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don’t share a common language.

### Hallucinatory Terrain

**4th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

---

### Harm

**6th-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d10 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.

---

Until the spell ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

---

Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d12 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 2nd.

A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by 4d8, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.

At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes.

Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

### Ice Storm

**4th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage and 4d10 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Hailstones turn the storm’s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 4th.

### Identify

**1st-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

### Illusory Script

**1st-level illusion (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 10 days

You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration. To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.

Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.

A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.

---

### Imprisonment

**9th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment:

- **Burial:** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. (Special component: a small mithral orb)
- **Chaining:** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then. (Special component: a fine chain of precious metal)
- **Hedged Prison:** The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. (Special component: a miniature representation of the prison made from jade)
- **Minimus Containment:** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. (Special component: a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby)
- **Slumber:** The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. (Special component: rare soporific herbs)

Ending the Spell: During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

### Incendiary Cloud

**8th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d12 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.

---

### Inflict Wounds

**1st-level necromancy**

---

### Insect Plague

**5th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere’s area is difficult terrain.

When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

_At Higher Levels:_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 5th.

---

### Instant Summons

**6th-level conjuration (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.

At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item’s name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.

If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.

Dispel magic or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell’s effect.

---

### Invisibility

**2nd-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

_At Higher Levels:_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

---

### Irresistible Dance

**6th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.

A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.

### Jump

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a grasshopper’s hind leg)

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with arcane lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.

When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.

---

### Legend Lore

**5th-level divination**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn’t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.

The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language.

---

### Lesser Restoration

**2nd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action

A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

---

### Magic Circle

**3rd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

- The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
- Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.

When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.

---

### Magic Jar

**6th-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoid's body.

You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.

While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

---

### Magic Missile

**1st-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d8 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.

---

### Magic Mouth

**2nd-level illusion (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object.

---

### Magic Weapon

**2nd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.

### Magnificent Mansion

**7th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.

Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

---

### Major Image

**3rd-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

---

### Mass Cure Wounds

**5th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point.

Each target regains hit points equal to 3d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 5th.

---

### Mass Heal

**9th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

---

### Mass Healing Word

**3rd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

---

### Mass Suggestion

**6th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t met before the spell ends, the activity isn’t performed.

If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.

---

### Maze

**8th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze. The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check.

If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

---

### Meld into Stone

**3rd-level transmutation (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can’t move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d10 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

### Mending

**Transmutation cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chainlink, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.

---

### Message

**Transmutation cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

---

### Meteor Swarm

**9th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d10 fire damage and 20d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.

The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

### Mind Blank

**8th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition. The spell even foils wish spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target’s mind or to gain information about the target.

---

### Minor Illusion

**Illusion cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

---

### Mirage Arcane

**7th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Sight
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain’s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.

Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

---

### Mirror Image

**2nd-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

---

### Mislead

**5th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

---

### Misty Step

**2nd-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

---

### Modify Memory

**5th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

### Moonbeam

**2nd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 4d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

---

### Move Earth

**6th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils—clay, loam, and sand)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.

Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.

This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

### Nondetection

**3rd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 gp sprinkled over the target, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

---

### Pass without Trace

**2nd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

---

### Passwall

**5th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.

---

### Phantasmal Killer

**4th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 8d8 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 4th.

---

### Phantom Steed

**3rd-level illusion (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

---

### Planar Ally

**6th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).

When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.

If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane. A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

---

### Planar Binding

**5th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.

---

### Plane Shift

**7th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.

---

### Plant Growth

**3rd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action or 8 hours
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.

If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected.

If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

---

### Poison Spray

**Conjuration cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage.

This spell's damage increases by 2d10 when you reach 5th level (4d10), 11th level (6d10), and 17th level (8d10).

---

### Polymorph

**4th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

### Power Word Kill

**9th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 200 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

---

### Power Word Stun

**8th-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

---

### Prayer of Healing

**2nd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 2nd.

---

### Prestidigitation

**Transmutation cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Up to 1 hour

This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
- You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
- You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
- You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
- You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

---

### Prismatic Spray

**7th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d12 to determine which color ray affects it.

1. Red: The target takes 10d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
2. Orange: The target takes 10d10 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
3. Yellow: The target takes 10d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
4. Green: The target takes 10d10 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
5. Blue: The target takes 10d10 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
6. Indigo: On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
7. Violet: On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
8. Special: The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.

---

### Prismatic Wall

**9th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.

The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.

The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.

1. Red: The creature takes 10d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
2. Orange: The creature takes 10d10 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.
3. Yellow: The creature takes 10d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.
4. Green: The creature takes 10d10 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.
5. Blue: The creature takes 10d10 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.
6. Indigo: On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.

While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.
7. Violet: On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

### Private Sanctum

**4th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:

- Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
- Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.

### Produce Flame

**Conjuration cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 fire damage.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

---

### Programmed Illusion

**6th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

---

### Project Image

**7th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 500 miles
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

### Protection from Energy

**3rd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

---

### Protection from Evil and Good

**1st-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

---

### Protection from Poison

**2nd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.

---

### Purify Food and Drink

**1st-level transmutation (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

All nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.

---

### Raise Dead

**5th-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

### Ray of Enfeeblement

- **Level:** 2nd-level Necromancy
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.

At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.

### Ray of Frost

- **Level:** Cantrip (Evocation)
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d12 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The spell’s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

### Regenerate

- **Level:** 7th-level Transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d12 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.

### Reincarnate

- **Level:** 5th-level Transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target’s soul isn’t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.

The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature’s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.

d100 | Race
----|----
01–04 | Dragonborn
05–13 | Dwarf, hill
14–21 | Dwarf, mountain
22–25 | Elf, dark
26–34 | Elf, high
35–42 | Elf, wood
43–46 | Gnome, forest
47–52 | Gnome, rock
53–56 | Half-elf
57–60 | Half-orc
61–68 | Halfling, lightfoot
69–76 | Halfling, stout
77–96 | Human
97–00 | Tiefling

The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.

### Remove Curse

- **Level:** 3rd-level Abjuration
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner’s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

### Resilient Sphere

- **Level:** 4th-level Evocation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

### Resistance

- **Level:** Cantrip (Abjuration)
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature cloak)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.

### Resurrection

- **Level:** 7th-level Necromancy
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.

This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

### Reverse Gravity

- **Level:** 7th-level Transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.

If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

### Revivify

- **Level:** 3rd-level Necromancy
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

### Rope Trick

- **Level:** 2nd-level Transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.

The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.

Attacks and spells can’t cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.

Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.

### Sacred Flame

- **Level:** Cantrip (Evocation)
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d12 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The spell’s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

### Sanctuary

- **Level:** 1st-level Abjuration
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.

### Scorching Ray

- **Level:** 2nd-level Evocation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 fire damage.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.

### Scrying

- **Level:** 5th-level Divination
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

**Knowledge** | **Save Modifier**
--- | ---
Secondhand (you have heard of the target) | +5
Firsthand (you have met the target) | +0
Familiar (you know the target well) | −5

**Connection** | **Save Modifier**
--- | ---
Likeness or picture | −2
Possession or garment | −4
Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | −10

On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.

### Secret Chest

- **Level:** 4th-level Conjuration
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).

While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell’s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.

### See Invisibility

- **Level:** 2nd-level Divination
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.

### Seeming

- **Level:** 5th-level Illusion
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours

This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.

The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

### Sending

- **Level:** 3rd-level Evocation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Unlimited
- **Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn’t arrive.

### Sequester

- **Level:** 7th-level Transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.

If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

### Shapechange

- **Level:** 9th-level Transmutation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once.

You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.

Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.

You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.

During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.

### Shatter

- **Level:** 2nd-level Evocation
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 2nd.

### Shield

- **Level:** 1st-level Abjuration
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction (when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell)
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.

### Shield of Faith

- **Level:** 1st-level Abjuration
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.

### Shillelagh

- **Level:** Cantrip (Transmutation)
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature’s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d12. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

### Shocking Grasp

- **Level:** Cantrip (Evocation)
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell’s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

### Silence

**2nd-level illusion (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

### Silent Image

**1st-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

### Simulacrum

**7th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 12 hours
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature’s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.

The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.

If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.

If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.

### Sleep

**1st-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d12; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d12 for each slot level above 1st.

### Sleet Storm

**3rd-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.

If a creature is concentrating in the spell’s area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.

### Slow

**3rd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted.

A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

### Spare the Dying

**Necromancy cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

### Speak with Animals

**1st-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts are limited by their intelligence, but at a minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM’s discretion.

### Speak with Dead

**3rd-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.

### Speak with Plants

**3rd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

This spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.

### Spider Climb

**2nd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

### Spike Growth

**2nd-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d8 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

### Spirit Guardians

**3rd-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d12 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d12 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.

### Spiritual Weapon

**2nd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble that weapon.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

### Stinking Cloud

**3rd-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

### Stone Shape

**4th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible.

### Stoneskin

**4th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

### Storm of Vengeance

**9th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Sight
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.

Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces additional effects on your turn.
- **Round 2:** Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d10 acid damage.
- **Round 3:** You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Round 4:** Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage.
- **Rounds 5–10:** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d10 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.

### Suggestion

**2nd-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed. If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

### Sunbeam

**6th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d12 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends. For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

### Sunburst

**8th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d10 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded. This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.

### Symbol

**7th-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

- **Death:** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 20d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

- **Discord:** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

- **Fear:** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

- **Hopelessness:** Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.

- **Insanity:** Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.

- **Pain:** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.

- **Sleep:** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

- **Stunning:** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

### Telekinesis

**5th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

**Creature:** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

**Object:** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell. You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

### Telepathic Bond

**5th-level divination (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren’t affected by this spell.

Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can’t extend to other planes of existence.

### Teleport

**7th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table below.

| **Familiarity** | **Similar** | **Off** | **On** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Permanent circle** | — | — | — |
| **Associated object** | — | — | — |
| **Very familiar** | 01–05 | 06–13 | 14–24 |
| **Seen casually** | 01–33 | 34–43 | 44–53 |
| **Viewed once** | 01–43 | 44–53 | 54–73 |
| **Description** | 01–43 | 44–53 | 54–73 |
| **False destination** | 01–50 | 51–100 | — |

**Familiarity:** "Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. "Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a magister’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.

"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.

"False destination" is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

- **On Target:** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.
- **Off Target:** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 2d8 × 2d8 percent of the distance that was to be traveled.
- **Similar Area:** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.
- **Mishap:** The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 6d8 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

### Teleportation Circle

**5th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 1 round

As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

### Thaumaturgy

**Transmutation cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Up to 1 minute

You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

- Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.
- You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
- You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
- You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

### Thunderwave

**1st-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cube)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d12 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

- **At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

### Time Stop

**9th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d8 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.

This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.

### Tiny Hut

**3rd-level evocation (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal bead)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.

### Tongues

**3rd-level divination**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.

### Transport via Plants

**6th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

This spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.

### Tree Stride

**5th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you’re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered. You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.

### True Polymorph

**9th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.

This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.

**Creature into Creature:** If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions. The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

**Object into Creature:** You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and the creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement. If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.

**Creature into Object:** If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.

### True Resurrection

**9th-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points. This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

### True Seeing

**6th-level divination**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.

### True Strike

**Divination cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round

You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn’t ended.

### Unseen Servant

**1st-level conjuration (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

### Vampiric Touch

**3rd-level necromancy**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

- **At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

### Vicious Mockery

**Enchantment cantrip**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

- **At Higher Levels:** This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

### Wall of Fire

**4th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d12 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d12 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

- **At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 4th.

### Wall of Force

**5th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free-floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

### Wall of Ice

**6th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d10 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d10 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d10, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d10, for each slot level above 6th.

### Wall of Stone

**5th-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small block of granite)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

### Wall of Thorns

**6th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d12 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d12 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d12 for each slot level above 6th.

### Warding Bond

**2nd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.

### Water Breathing

**3rd-level transmutation (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.

### Water Walk

**3rd-level transmutation (ritual)**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cork)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.

If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.

### Web

**2nd-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.

If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d8 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

### Weird

**9th-level illusion**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 8d8 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

### Wind Walk

**6th-level transmutation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (fire and holy water)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.

If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

### Wind Wall

**3rd-level evocation**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.

### Wish

**9th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.
- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.
- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.

The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 2d8 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d8 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.

### Word of Recall

**6th-level conjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect. You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.

### Zone of Truth

**2nd-level enchantment**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
